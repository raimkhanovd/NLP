watching time chasers it obvious that it was made by a bunch of friends
maybe they were sitting around one day in film school and said hey let s pool our money together and make a really bad movie or something like that
what ever they said they still ended up making a really bad movie dull story bad script lame acting poor cinematography bottom of the barrel stock music etc
all corners were cut except the one that would have prevented this film s release
life s like that
i saw this film about years ago and remember it as being particularly nasty
i believe it is based on a true incident a young man breaks into a nurses home and rapes tortures and kills various women it is in black and white but saves the colour for one shocking shot at the end the film seems to be trying to make some political statement but it just comes across as confused and obscene avoid
minor spoilersin new york joan barnard elvire audrey is informed that her husband the archeologist arthur barnard john saxon was mysteriously murdered in italy while searching an etruscan tomb
joan decides to travel to italy in the company of her colleague who offers his support
once in italy she starts having visions relative to an ancient people and maggots many maggots
after shootings and weird events joan realizes that her father is an international drug dealer there are drugs hidden in the tomb and her colleague is a detective of the narcotic department
the story ends back in new york when joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other in a very romantic end
yesterday i had the displeasure of wasting my time watching this crap
the story is so absurd mixing thriller crime supernatural and horror and even a romantic end in a non sense way
the acting is the worst possible highlighting the horrible performance of the beautiful elvire audrey
john saxon just gives his name to the credits and works less than five minutes when his character is killed
the special effects are limited to maggots everywhere
the direction is ridiculous
i lost a couple of hours of my life watching assassinio al cimitero etrusco
if you have the desire or curiosity of seeing this trash choose another movie go to a pizzeria watch tv go sleep navigate in internet go to the gym but do not waste your time like i did
my vote is two title brazil o mist rio etrusco the etruscan mystery
i went to see this film with a great deal of excitement as i was at school with the director he was even a good friend of mine for a while
but sorry mate this film stinks i can only talk about what was wrong with the first half because that s when i walked out and went to the pub for a much needed drink someone s standing on a balcony about to jump and so you send a helicopter to shine a searchlight on them
i don t think so nothing would make them more likely to jump local radio doesn t send reporters to cover people about to attempt suicide again for fear of pressuring them into jumping or for fear of encouraging copy cat instances whatever the circumstances radio reporters don t do live broadcasts from the th floor of a tower block
radio cars don t carry leads long enough to connect the microphone and headphones to the transmitter the stuck in the lift scene was utterly derivative the acting and direction was almost non existent i could go on but i won t
yes i agree with everyone on this site this movie is very very bad
to even call this a movie is an insult to all movies ever made
it s minutes long someone compares this movie to an after school special
b i n g o
that describes is perfectly the packaging for this movie intentionally is misleading
for example the title of this movie should describe the movie
rubberface
that should be the first hint
it was retitled with a new package of some goofy face jim probably made in his stand up days
i was hoping for more stand up from jim
if you like jim now as an actor
you would love him in his stand up days
still trying to locate the rodney dangerfield young comedians special from hbo that featured jim in his early career days
it isn t even mentioned on this site
i d love to find anything jim did stand up wise also jim carrey is a supporting actor in this movie
the main character is very very annoying
she is some girl lacking self confidence but yet wants to be a stand up comedian
jim is there to say lines like that s funny janet and you really are talented
and honestly she is terrible really terrible
and the movie is terrible
beware of false advertising and a really bad movie
jennifer ehle was sparkling in pride and prejudice jeremy northam was simply wonderful in the winslow boy with actors of this caliber this film had to have a lot going for it
even those who were critical of the movie spoke of the wonderful sequences involving these two
i was eager to see it it is with bitter disappointment however that i must report that this flick is a piece of trash
the scenes between ehle and northam had no depth or tenderness or real passion they consisted of hackneyed and unsubtle latter day cinematic lust voracious open mouthed kissing and soft porn humping
lust can be entertaining if it s done with originality this was tasteless and awful ehle and northam have sullied their craft they should be ashamed as for the modern part of the romance i was unnerved by the effeminate appearance of the male lead
aren t there any masculine men left in hollywood the plot was kind of interesting with a better script and a more imaginative director it might have worked
amy poehler is a terrific comedian on saturday night live but her role in this movie doesn t give her anything to work with
her character a publisher s representative guiding a new author on a book tour is mean not funny susan sarandon plays the author s mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher billy bob thorton the author had when he was a chubby junior high student
unfortunately her role doesn t require a talented actress
the funniest thing is the way she looks in the awful gown she wears as the queen of the corn festival
there is no explanation of why the corn queen is old enough to have a grown son the plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice still it is not the worst movie i ve ever seen and i didn t erase it before watching it
a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm including the ceo s daughter goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest
when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission
but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods
oy what a mess this film was
it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film
it suffers from two major flaws and they re probably both writer director jonas quastel s fault this film which i ll be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing i ve ever seen next to alone in the dark and quastel s constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay let s try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise non sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible the potential was there
despite the rip off aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator ed wood like exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts
the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes
the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from to at least and spent more time exploring their relationships
the monster s lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers
if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason quastel thinks it s a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so on for some reason he thinks it s a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway for some reason he doesn t care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc
he just cuts to them at random
for that matter the scenes we re shown appear to be selected at random
important events either never or barely appear and we re stuck with far too many pointless scenes for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because it s not that important the monster s intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another way for some reason there is a whole character mary mancini left in the script even though she s superfluous for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft core porno scene even though the motif is never repeated again for some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like they re stereotypes of asian domestics for some reason quastel insists on using the blurry cam and distorto cam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesn t look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematography i could go on but you get the idea i really wanted to like this film better than i did i m a henriksen fan i m intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level but i just couldn t
every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end quastel made some other awful move
in the end my score was a out of
a well made gritty science fiction movie it could be lost among hundreds of other similar movies but it has several strong points to keep it near the top
for one the writing and directing is very solid and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci fi cliches though not all of them
it does a good job of keeping you in suspense and the landscape and look of the movie will appeal to sci fi fans if you re looking for a masterpiece this isn t it
but if you re looking for good old fashioned post apoc gritty future in space sci fi with good suspense and special effects then this is the movie for you
thoroughly enjoyable and a good ending
incredibly dumb and utterly predictable story of a rich teen girl who not given love by her parents starts a girl gang
they rob gas stations rape guys
and kill a policeman all the teenagers in this film are easily in their late s early s the acting is all horrible and the script has every cliche imaginable with hilarious dialogue it comes as no surprise that it was written by the immortal ed wood jr worth seeing for laughs
best lines they re shooting back and it ain t supposed to be like this
after reading the comments for this movie i am not sure whether i should be angry sad or sickened
seeing comments typical of people who a know absolutely nothing about the military or b who base everything they think they know on movies like this or on cnn reports about abu gharib makes me wonder about the state of intellectual stimulation in the world at the time i type this the number of people in the us military million on active duty with another almost in the guard and reserves for a total of roughly million the number of people indicted for abuses at at abu gharib currently less than that makes the total of people indicted of the total military
even if you indict every single military member that ever stepped in to abu gharib you would not come close to making that a whole number
the flaws in this movie would take years to cover
i understand that it s supposed to be sarcastic but in reality the writer and director are trying to make commentary about the state of the military without an enemy to fight
in reality the us military has been at its busiest when there are not conflicts going on
the military is the first called for disaster relief and humanitarian aid missions
when the tsunami hit indonesia devestating the region the us military was the first on the scene
when the chaos of the situation overwhelmed the local governments it was military leadership who looked at their people the same people this movie mocks and said make it happen
within hours food aid was reaching isolated villages
within days airfields were built cargo aircraft started landing and a food distribution system was up and running
hours and days not weeks and months
yes there are unscrupulous people in the us military
but then there are in every walk of life every occupation
but to see people on this website decide that million men and women are all criminal with nothing on their minds but thoughts of destruction or mayhem is an absolute disservice to the things that they do every day
one person on this website even went so far as to say that military members are in it for personal gain
wow
entry level personnel make just under an hour assuming a hour work week
of course many work much more than hours a week and those in harm s way typically put in hour days for months on end
that makes the pay well under minimum wage
so much for personal gain
i beg you please make yourself familiar with the world around you
go to a nearby base get a visitor pass and meet some of the men and women you are so quick to disparage
you would be surprised
the military no longer accepts people in lieu of prison time
they require a minimum of a ged and prefer a high school diploma
the middle ranks are expected to get a minimum of undergraduate degrees and the upper ranks are encouraged to get advanced degrees
it s hard to describe elfen lied to someone who hasn t heard of it the closest i can think of is a strange mix of extreme violence romance and drama
to those of you who haven t witnessed it you re probably wondering how these are all incorporated into the one piece coherently
those that have though are instead pondering why they haven t been put together sooner
such is the quality and flow of this odd hybrid of an anime
the real area that elfen lied shines is it s narrative its hard not to be enthralled by its weaving course and diversity
a violent and gory encounter will perhaps gives way to another with a contrasting lighter moment
emotive drama gives way to bloodshed and then back again only this time bring you close to tears as it does so
it s a strange combination where you as the viewer are thrown about and manipulated like those in the story line itself but one that works surprisingly well
it does this all the while without feeling disjointed it has an elegance and clever subtly when it makes these strong transitions that makes it all the more mesmorising this is carefully finished with a truly memorable musical score which in my opinion is another great strength
the opening lilium is particularly powerful and differing versions feature prominently throughout lending its intensity to emotive scenes
however regarding music there s an off kilter over happy pop song that plays over the credits after each episode
it feels out of place but never the less is adequate enough and it could be argued adds a good contrast to what is at times quite a depressing anime i must reiterate however that the violence is somewhat extreme and i advise you to be prepared for it if you are faint hearted
however by no means avoid this because of it there s a lot more to it than the violence and you will be denying yourself a truly wondrous experience by not watching it
it is to any fan of the medium unmissable a weird cocktail of conflicting ideas that on paper shouldn t work but some how is pulled off in spectacular fashion gripping you from the start to it s brutal conclusion
still not convinced
well ask yourself this is there anything else out there that can lay claim to being disturbing and yet at the same time profoundly beautiful
it s worth watching on that premise alone
of all the bile inducing vomitoriums to squeeze out of tinseltown s bloody sphincter over the past years this is indisputably the worst of the lot
carvey s one man show is such a poor excuse for comedy that it doesn t even deserve to get raked by the mst crew
i swear i actually felt nauseated after watching this festering pile of manure
in order to lengthen the lame minute running time the producers padded the end credits to ten minutes with lame ass carvey impressions that surely couldn t even make the last few minutes of that god awful saturday night live tv show
in it you can see carvey imitating other notable actors who surely don t deserve the indignity
did i mention it features jessica simpson in a cameo
yech
if you ever plan on watching this stinking puke fest you might want to make sure you have plenty of pepto bisthmol beforehand
this is quite an underrated hitchcock movie
while its not one of his best movies this is actually quite good
the plot is very world war inspired so that may be part of why it is overlooked
this does have classic hitchcock suspense moments though although the best one comes towards the end
a lot of dialogue here too and tallulah bankhead does an excellent job
worth checking out if you are a fan
being a huge gary oldman fan i had high hopes for this film
and the deleverence straw dogs esquire story about an english couple vacationing at their friends house in a remote part of spain where they find a poor child locked away in chains and have to face the wraith of local villagers started off well enough
it had some good atmosphere and it kept my attention however sadly it seems to run out of steam and lose it s direction somewhere along the way
i felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending however at that point i no longer cared it is always cool to see oldman though my grade c eye candy virginie ledoyen aitana s nchez gij n both bare all lion s gate region dvd extras trailers for the eye remake retribution christie s revenge dead man s bounty blood trails and a promo for fear net
for the most part the acting was poorly done especially on part of the park ranger and the stories were anything but scary
predictable and rather poorly shot even if there was a low budget
the idea for this movie was a good one it just wasn t pulled off
ram gopal varma does it again yet another movie which draws you into the reality of underworld and introduces you to the machinery of mumbai underworld d is a story of a young aggressive man deshu who gets into the underworld and changes the orthodox ways of its operation he defies the ongoing practices and with his courage he is in the driving seat just after some time he joins the gang randeep hooda comes as a surprise this young chap from haryana delivers a performance which is really amazing
last time when we saw randeep hooda he was in a small appearance in monsoon wedding but this movie shows his potential he resembles to chandu of company but definitely does it better than vivek oberoi satya and company were on the same lines of d but definitely satya is the best among the three d company music wise is not up to the mark but songs are hardly part of the story performance wise the movie is a full of good performances chunky pandey gives a great performance and fits to the role then there are artists like goga kapoor sushant singh who can never go wrong isha kopikar had very little scope but her costumes and body language was perfect for the small time when she was on screen if you enjoyed satya and company this movie is a sure go for you don t expect any mercy from varma productions because there is ample of on screen violence and tension like the previous two flicks
i gave it for some attempt at historical detail to echo another reviewer all the actors behave as in the th st centuries not the victorian th
the actors behave far too freely and with hardly any attempt at the formal dignity stiff social restraint of the time and no apparent attempt to represent the social mores and customs of the era
watch the original version with ralph richardson to see what i m driving at or watch zulu zulu dawn or charge of the light brigade for more authentic historical recreation of how people were in those days the battle scenes in this version may have been fierce but the pacing was far too th century
even warfare was a more formal and dignified affair then than it is today
it took the first world war to change that if you want th st century romance and military heroics transposed to the th century this film is ok for anything more historically real best look elsewhere
i wanted to watch this one sense i am a fan of films such as last house on the left and maniac
this film follows in this same gener only less satisfying to watch than those above
this movie is about a garage worker who leads a double life as a serial rapeist watching young women and taking advantage of them at the apropriate moment
he stutters when he s with a girl and starts to feel nervous which i felt was unapprpriate for the movie
then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching tv or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim
this i also found unnecisary in the movie
the part that i did like in the movie as compared to maniac was the fact that we get to see what the killers thinking and just why he commits these murders and i liked that
always wanted to know just what made those serial killers tick
but this one didn t tick to much for me i gave it a
che is a good film for chronicling the events leading to the cuban revolution and certainly has a mystic potency surrounding che and his political ideals
however there is no emotional core or compassionate deliverance to make this anything more than interesting and is a friendly inspection of che s mindset rather than anything inspiring the events in che offer insight into guerrilla warfare but it fails to capture the imagination
much of the score in che is over dramatic and frictional to the narrative it tries to up the tempo but it comes across as rather willful and disjointed
as the war continues comrades die and characters which you have been deliberately introduced to perish without a second glance
the biggest failure for che is that it does not have any emotional engagement with its characters it is happy to leisurely move through the film che is a likable film but it does not grip or pull at your heartstrings
the film is well made but it is a film produced almost with an educational edge
rather than exploring che and his revolutionaries with any passion it glides steadily along to an ending well suited to its purpose
this film is very disturbing
it reminded me of the love and affection and materialistic things that we all want for ourselves
it s a movie about how fame fortune and a notion of that being rich will make your life better might end up destroying you it s been almost years since the films release and yet today it remain as relevant as ever as still the biggest stars in the world gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film
britney spears and michael jackson comes to mind
like norma in the film these people are kings
but no amount of money or fame can save them from their own destruction
and that is the tragedy and yet the world goes on and we keep dreaming about fame and fortune
will we ever learn
this film disturbs me
it s like looking into the state of mind of human beliefs
we all wanna be pop stars and drive around in fancy cars
we do think it will make us more happy
will it norma viii x
let me put it this way
i love bad movies
i pretty much grew up with mst k since i was about
i often rent cheesy horror and action films for a good laugh
this movie made the original godzilla movies look like oscar worthy films
they even try to make their monster seem more powerful and more impressive with the line this guy makes godzilla look like a pussy well at least any godzilla films japan or usa versions has better plots and acting
the special effects were awful
a special effect is supposed to blend in to make creature or other objects look like they are real
the special effects in this film stick out big time
i would not wish this film on anyone stars out of
from the combined ministries of jack and rexella van impe and john hagee comes revelation the second in a trilogy of films about somebody s conception of the end times
i say somebody s because even fundamentalist christians are by no means united about prophesying things to come i ve not seen the first of these films apocalypse in which a united world government is established and the rapture has taken place
a guy who even calls himself the messiah named macaluso played by nick mancuso has taken over the world and it s either his way or the highway christians are not even united on whether there will even be a rapture but i m of the opinion that if the fundamentalists are right and whole lots of people that you know feel that way suddenly vanish it might give some tangible proof about the bible being real
but it has happened and it s happened to jeff fahey s family wife and daughter who just vanished without a trace
she could never quite get him to church and he s been left behind as a result
anyway under the regime of messiah macaluso those who are not followers of his are deemed haters and are rounded up and also disappear in more conventional ways fahey finds himself questioning what s going on and when he does he s framed for his partner s murder and forced to flee among the haters
who in his city include former news anchor leigh lewis who in the first film had been the first to denounce macaluso for being satan mancuso s got something called a day of wonders where folks will be asked to participate in a virtual reality game en masse
since we know who mancuso is it s something not good and its up to the believer types to throw a monkey wrench into the works
carol alt and tony nappo play a blind and a paraplegic people respectively and when they play the game they are healed and become mancuso s disciples
that s a mighty hard thing to give up healing from some affliction to reject mancuso david roddis has an over the top performance as one of mancuso s acolytes who s playing his villain in the best snidely whiplash tradition
all he needed was a handlebar mustache to twirl at both ends it s impossible to evaluate these films because believer folk will hang on every word and nonbelievers will inevitably scoff
then it degenerates into a theological not a cinema discussion
the cast give it their best to inject reality in some far fetched notions there was a scene that really wasn t terribly germane to the plot where a father turns in his son for re education because he caught him with a bible
i took a look on the actor darrel hicks who played the son and found he d also later done work on queer as folks
talk about an eclectic resume the ending is positively biblical itself
just think of shadrach meshach and abednego
ghost world is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while
the story was very sweet and it gives people who are hopeless like myself hope
this is because the ugly but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love
i don t usually see that in todays moviesthe movie consists of many interesting characters and the actors who played the characters did an outstanding job especially thora birch and steve buscemi
the settings in the movie was good and i liked how the movie used different room colors for different occasions in this movie there are some problems of this movie
the movie was a little bit long and sometimes the story drags

scarlett johanson character seemed pretty small it would be nice to more a little bit of scarlett johanson character this movie was funny sweet and interesting
if you are sick of the ordinary teen movies you should watch this interesting little teen movie called ghost world
outstanding film dealing with a year old who tries to bring stability to a totally dysfunctional family there is a truly outstanding performance by anne heche as the dysfunctional mother who neglects her children to lead a most disgusting life in pursuit of a good time
heche is ably supported by diane ladd a religious woman who can quote the bible but could not control her rebellious daughter the film deals with how a sharp year old has to learn to play the system to keep her brothers together
bright perceptive and unfortunately victimized by a sick mother kristen bell gives a splendid performance i enjoyed the part where she meets a black young man who becomes her boyfriend
nothing is made of the inter racial relationship nor the fact that the young man has a black father and white mother this film shows that a court system can work to the advantage of its victims
this movie did play like a dream or maybe even like an autobiography it was disjointed
it was basically a bunch of mostly random scenes throughout this lady s life and you wonder what is going to happen next to her
the scenery was beautiful but that is the only redeeming value i could find
wait for it to come to tv
this film is supposedly based on the true account of a prisoner who escaped from devil s island in french guiana
however the book by henri charriere about his experiences apparently has a lot of inconsistencies and outright fabrications a polite way of saying he was a liar
so provided you understand that this isn t quite a true story this is still an exceptional film
much of this is due to incredible acting direction scripting and makeup henri charriere played by steve mcqueen is going to devil s island for killing a pimp supposedly in self defense
on the boat he meets a swindler played by dustin hoffman and they become friends most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement
all take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners by charriere is resilient
despite all these privations he never loses his resolve to escape though hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt
in the end charriere does escape though in real life this apparently did not occur while there is a lot more to the movie and what i have mentioned after all it s a very long and involved film the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison
so be prepared for a movie that at times is very difficult to watch but is constructed it s an amazing film
i know that cartoons aimed towards adults generally don t get the attention they deserve because they get written off as childish or don t capture interests as quickly as attractive famous real life characters can
but please give this show a chance
i promise that just one episode of this show will have you hooked
i haven t laughed out loud this much since arrested development r i p
and the humor is similarly fast paced and at times absurd
the show is a half hour long divided into two minute episodes which makes the show very watchable even for people who don t think they can devote an entire minutes to a cartoon everything about this show is hilarious the scenarios the dry dialogue the buildup to inevitable madness and the horribly drawn but wonderfully fleshed out characters
the show follows tim who is frequently caught in admittedly outlandish situations although they always seem to spiral out of control so realistically
he and the supporting cast of characters all have their own stand out performances including debbie the friend hooker and amy the girlfriend who is perpetually disappointed in her well meaning but just plain awful boyfriend
so before you write it off simply because it s an adult cartoon watch just one episode
hell even watch one half of an episode
that s minutes of your time that will quickly lead to you watching every episode i promise
but what a disappointment
the acting was superb
the cinematography was gorgeous
the stimulated sex particularly the gay stuff quite hot
however the characters were totally unbelievable as everything was driven by plot line nothing by the characters
surely to g d this was not the first time campbell scott s character had stepped out on his wife so she must have known something was going on
he would have been clever enough to ensure she never found out
we are led to believe she is naive to the ways of the world and yet knows to how to find and hire a private detective and gather enough information to gaslight another person so cleverly
this compassionate woman suddenly turns into a total freak
and the up and coming scuse the pun screenwriter is supposed to be a man of the world and yet believes his dead lover speaks to him in a computer chat room
the whole thing about the poisonous plants gee can you say foreshadowing
we rented the dvd and i left the room to do other things about half an hour before the end because i simply could not waste my time any longer
as a long time holmes fan and particularly of the jeremy brett interpretations i was fully prepared to dislike this one intensely
however i did enjoy it and can recommend it though with some warnings as several have mentioned the time warp is annoying for those who know the genre
while it s certainly possible that holmes might have come out of retirement at a young age this is pushing it a bit far
holmes and watson were at least in their mid to late twenties in the s so an edwardian
setting would have them each pushing i don t recall seeing this everett guy before but i think they could have done better
however after seeing poor charlton heston doing holmes i won t squawk too loudly
everett seems to play up the jaded effeminate edwardian dandy routine a bit much for me aside from the earlier mentioned telephone disparity and perhaps too routine use of fingerprints i was particularly aggravated by the reference at the end to james whistler s famous work commonly known as whistler s mother
holmes refers to it as something like portrait in gray whereas the actual title is arrangement in gray and black or black and gray
if as screenwriter is determined to be that pretentious he should at least do the research and get it right the plot seemed to be cheating a bit to me too as others have mentioned but i did like it warts and all
maybe a or out of
in two sentimental movie so alike was make one is this and the other is simon birch
both are about the boy tried to make a different in this world despite the fact that they are disable
this movie star elden henson as the boy with disturb past and kieran culkin as the disable boy they two become friend and that when imaginary adventure begin the movie also consist of many a lister star such as gena rowlands sharon stone gillian anderson meat loaf and james gandolfini
yes that is one hell of a cast but that doesn t really save this film anyway
the movie is dreadful because by the end of the movie you ll wish you never seen it cause it is too slow and boring the script wasn t that bad at all the character is well written but the situation is boring and dreadful and the sentimental stuff was overdone that it end up being really cheesy
the acting wasn t all bad but the set was boring and unimaginative
and the lighting and cinematography didn t do a good job it as if the film was shot decades back reason to watch better not watch it reason not to you won t miss a thing feel like waste of electricity watching it rating grade f please rate y n after reading thanks
many of you have posted comments on clockwatchers as a portrayal of office life not true
it is a movie based on each of the main characters personal identity struggle and nothing more than that
watch it again and forget that they are in an office setting focus on the personalities you see in each of the main characters i ll give you a hint lisa kudrow s character has bulimia nervosa guess who has ocd never ignore the obvious and never over look the obscure a great movie
stars
for years friends expressed amazement that i had never watched nip tuck just my kind of show they insisted
and so spurred by the recent assault of pre season publicity i decided to pay a first time visit to nip tuck last night
i was expecting sly and witty satire
what i found instead in repeat episodes that focused on a serial mangler and a deranged racist was a puerile unrelenting torrent of violence and sadism
robotic and or hysterical acting moronic plot contortions and enough deep shadow in miami yet to make edgar ulmer spin like a top
it was like watching joel schumacher direct ricky martin as hannibal lecter
nice to know what my friends think of my taste
st watched out of dir anthony hickox lame and silly attempt to spoof horror movies in this story about a possessed wax museum visited by brainless teenagers
a couple of them get swept into the exhibits and the story that revolves around the exhibits and then they get killed and become permanent parts of it
this is the basic storyline but they add a rule the world theme concocted by the leader of the museum
he believes that once each exhibit has had it s chance to kill they will all come to life and conquer all

mu ha ha
the movie has a campiness that makes you think initially it will be a comedy but it really just turns into a slow moving horror movie
the exhibits include the werewolf a vampire the marquis de sade and an alien that isn t really explored
this is where the movie tries to pay tribute to these type of movies but fails
at least the movie didn t turn out to be a kill all teens slasher movie and they tried a different style in the storytelling to put away the worthless teenagers but it still doesn t really work as an interesting movie
i thank the heavens for mst otherwise this movie would have been intolerable
it is a communal pain distributed among the watchers
first of all the protagonist is dr neil connery played by neil connery subtle
neil is sean connery s brother
you would not guess that from the great acting displayed in this movie
this movie is simply an italian knock off of a james bond movie except you couldn t afford any of the trademarks
they also managed to get some people who actually stared in bond movies like ms moneypenny lois maxwell m bernard lee and emilio largo from thunderball played by adolfo celi
thats about where all the similarities to any bond movie end
where james bond has a suave debonair style and uses various gadgets his brother neil user hypnosis and the jerry lewis approach
it s not that he is clumsy he just seems to be uncomfortable with women
the plot is pretty bad and nonsensical
by far the best part of the movie is the end conflict where neil and friends fight largo s minions who dress like the aliens from v red vinyl outfits with the helmets from the fireman of fahrenheit
not only that but they are all shooting underwater harpoons
exciting isn t it

this all leads to the duel between largo aka thair beta and neil
harpoons at paces
this movie is bad
please don t watch this movie unless you are heavily medicated
the gore in this film was good
thats about all the good i can say about this film
i see others saying the acting was good when i read other reviews on this film and i only have to say one thing about that what are you people taking
this was the worst acting i have ever seen and i have seen some really bad acting and the story
ooh very bad
there where to many hole in the script writing
and everybody is raving about a surprise ending
um mm people most film today are going into that direction of weird twisty endings
it s being overdone
all s i have to say about this film that seconds is seconds to long to watch it
i was duped into thinking that this was an actual movie
had i known it was a tv movie i would have spent the rental fee elsewhere
the jacket of the movie made it look like it d be funny but i was wrong
i didn t even laugh once during the entire flick and i m a person who laughs during a funny movie even if its as stupid as watching wiley e coyote blowing himself up others may say this is a good family movie but i wouldn t even let my own kids watch this movie
this must be one of the most refreshing surprises i saw in a long time
looks boring but it s ultrahilarious
in documentary style we learn something about australia s dirty history well this is a satire so don t check out the net for verification okay
we go back in the early fifties at where we find an australian communist joan fraser judy davis who really would give her life for the red star it goes so far that she can arrange to meet the man stalin himself all of course before the public knew of his slaughters and what joan never expected she ends up in bed with stalin but as the man is walking on his last feet he dies
agent nine sam neil tells her she s a hero who saved russia and that same night she also ends up in his bed not knowing what to do joan returns to australia finding out that she is pregnant
she doesn t tell her australian boyfriend who the father of her child is but the poor b d accepts
but soon trouble happens when agent nine returns to the land of the kangaroos cos the question is who is the father
he or stalin
things of hilarious things are following and we follow the days of the child joe welch richard roxburgh
for communist mum he s a perfect child always to be seen at manifestations against the vietnamwar but then the nightmare strikes joe falls in love with a female cop
really it s totally hilarious even if the personages always stay sober but it s the kind of script that leaves you not one minute in silence
a perfect film from a rather unknown director see it
great film i have this film got it off sky sum time and yes its freeky as hell there s no blood no swearing and sorry to those people that want to see it but no nudity well its censored
anyway i thought this film was real when i first seen it and i couldn t go anywhere alone i became paranoid that the aliens were gonna come get me
i think this film is psychological and really gets to you evan thought this film was fake some say it actually happened and this was the remake ethier way it still freaks me out to this day not as much but i get those shiverer s down my back when i watch it ps this film has names as far as i no alien abduction incident in lake county and alien abduction the macpherson tape
if you no of any others or the real tape please say
my local video rental store is eliminating all of their vhs tapes and as i am still trapped in the s and do not have a dvd player i was more than happy to take some off their hands
pick in choosing my for kindergarden ninja has proved to be just as the others have said the most entertaining use of a dollar you can find i hardly know where to begin
lets start with the cover of the movie
it is important to note that the creators in no way intended you to think there were real martial arts in this film
ninja in the title is in quotation as if to warn you of the fighting skills
the cover also declares say no to drugs
that s what got me interested in this film but the best part is inside at one part in the film blade steel ex nfl star dwight clark suggests that he and his date go to clark s on the bay dwight clark real life restaurant
as he says this the number to make a reservation at his his restaurant scrolls across the bottom of the screen
as they have their meal steel goes on stage to sing the motown hit miles from home
while on stage his date is suddenly kidnapped by ninjas
while continuing to hold the mic and sing steel defeats the ninjas and returns to the stage with a wink during the final fight scene steel his martial arts mentor and for a few brief seconds used as a weapon the kindergarten children fight a clan of drug dealing ninjas who throughout the film had been played by children but are now mysteriously grown men
during this action scene slow motion is actually filmed by the actors moving in slow motion
simply amazing the entire film is packed full of gems like this i doubt you ll ever be able to find this film but if you do please pick it up
it will definitely be worth the dollar you spend
to everyone reading the comments here as your well wisher i recommend not to see this movie i don t want to write anything about it some sensible people who have posted comments here and given a deserved bad review about it have already pointed out all the flaws of this movie
i just want to save a long good period of frustration and anger which i went through after watching it what a waste of a talented budding actor like vivek oberoi i pity him really
i am so embarrassed i have to give a rating of to this movie i thought would be there but it is not there so i am forced to give a rating of as far as the good reviews for this movie here are concerned i am surprised and shocked these good reviews here lead me to the imagination of s ghai or someone handsomely paid by him sitting spending some valuable hours cooking up false stories about this movie being great etcthants all
the absolute worst of the trilogy not even comedy could save it
unrealistic unbelievable loud sudden sounds the only scary component
really should have quit after one no
two was bad but not in the ball park compared to this disaster
nev campbell the only saving grace with the four votes given placed solely on her performance having to work under atrocious conditions
fletch is at again
but this time the premise is extremely worn out and the wisecracks are very tired and sometimes downright stupid it started so promising
when fletch finds out that he has inherited an estate in the deep south from an aunt he hardly knew we get a wicked satire of song of the south complete with animation and a singing chevy
when the scenery changes from l a to lousiana we get every southern stereotype known to man
the klan is apparently back in action and tries to get fletch to leave the estate which turns out to be not what it s cracked up to be
we also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like amanda ray ross and becky ann culpepper and you just know that the first thing fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him
the amanda ray character is not so lively the next morning and looks sort of like she was in the deep freeze for the entire night
can this be a comment on fletch s abilities in the sack or is there foul play involved
if you think it is the second answer you are absolutely right so next we meet a lawyer who seems to wanna help fletch do they do that
and we also meet a ranch hand who serves as fletch s only friend among hostile citizens
an amusing but not quite funny bit involves a tv evangelist played by the great r lee ermey but he doesn t seem sleazy enough to generate much suspicion towards him so the real culprit must be the most unlikely
have i given too much away
doesn t matter
the plot is not why we go to see this movie but the laughs are not there this time
a shame since i was looking forward to seeing this
you can only hope that there won t be another sequel
one of tennessee williams best plays becomes a good but not great film despite a stellar cast
it s hard to pin exactly why this film doesn t soar but it s a solid screen version
maybe it s just that the subject matter works better in a stage environment and that the camera is just too intimate familiar story of restless son his crippled sister and their manic mother who seems to live in the golden past is great material for the stage
and this sad story of the mother s attempts to goad the son into bringing home a young man to meet the sister seems rather cruel
but even the forgotten and lost can lead lives of desperation as they cling to dreams and make wishes on silver moons arthur kennedy stars as tom the son who tries to please his mother but longs to escape his dull job in st louis and see the world
jane wyman is the crippled sister who has shrunk from the world and collects tiny glass animals
gertrude lawrence is the mother who was abandoned by her husband and has been reduced to living in a dumpy apartment and selling magazine subscriptions
and kirk douglas is the gentleman caller all actors are quite good although none received oscar nominations despite the hype
many great actresses have been associated with the role of amanda wingfield since this play made its broadway debut in the s laurette taylor katharine hepburn joanne woodward maureen stapletobm jessica tandy julie harris and jessica lange have all played the role on stage film or tv
and i swear i remember shirley booth doing this on tv also ultimetaely the story is as fragile as the glass figures
if any one character dominates the story the whole play collapses
this film version works very well in balancing the roles
and while wyman seems a tad old for the part lawrence was an even odder choice
i ve also read that bette davis and tallulah bankhead were considered
but how they decided on lawrence a great musical comedy star in london and new york is anyone s guess
she really is quite good but the film might have need the extra star power of bette davis anyway this classic american play is worth watching
calling this movie one of the best dutch in recent years is perhaps not enough
it certainly deserves a spot among the best dutch movies of all time as well if i had to compare this movie to any other i would say that this movie is the dutch glengarry glen ross
it has only powerhouse actors in it the movie doesn t just have one main character it follows multiple story lines from all the different characters and it has an excellent written story
don t let the fact that this is just a made for tv movie scare you of
the only reason the movie didn t got a theatrical release is because dutch cinema in general is not very popular by the main stream audience and besides movies like this just don t do well in dutch cinema s regardless of the language spoken
a shame because that also in a way means that not too often dutch movies like cloaca will ever be made and released
this movie however truly screams for more the story at first starts of rather simple but just like in real life things are more complicated than they at first seem
every character in the movie has problem s on their own and the one thing that connects everything is their friendship
the four old college buddies now in their forties try to help each other but have to cope with their own difficulties as well
by helping each other out they discover the true meaning of friendship and start evaluation the way their lives are progressing thus far and where things went wrong for them and they let the good old times revive as well
it s a real character movie and a movie like this always requires some extremely good actors
cloaca really has this
it makes the movie the story and the situations in this all feel very real and understandable cloaca has the best acting you ll probably ever see in a dutch movie
all of the actors in this movie are well taught and established actors who appear mostly on the stage
it s too bad that dutch movies not too often give the chance to let actors like this shine on the silver screen
ductch cinema doesn t often offer roles like these to actors of this caliber
pierre bokma gijs scholten van aschat and pierre bokma are all probably the best dutch actors at the moment
it also definitely helps the movie that the three of them are real life friends and went to college together along with the movie its director willem van de sande bakhuyzen it definitely shows on screen since they all have such a great chemistry and share some great anticipation and reaction with each other
it lifts their performances to an even higher level and makes the timing spot on the movie is deliberately kept low key
no fancy tricks are used and the movie mostly relies on telling its story purely through its characters
it s based on a stage play by maria goos which starred for most part the same actors that also appear in this movie
it means that the movie also feels stagey at times with its characters and dialog
this doesn t always work out well in movies but there are exceptions and when there are exceptions they are always brilliant ones
cloaca is a wonderful example of this
it s a real shame by the way that the british kevin spacey stage play version wasn t an huge success the movie is extremely well directed by willem van de sande bakhuyzen
of course the storytelling is slow but van de sande bakhuyzen s directing keeps the pace always high and the movie interesting
the movie also has some beautiful cinematography and a suiting musical score
a real lost for dutch cinema that willem van de sande bakhuyzen died in of cancer
he made the best movies in his last years and i would had definitely been interested in seeing more movies of him definitely if they were like cloaca
to comment on this movie there are two main sides first one would be adam sandler i have always liked his movies for the light kind of comedy he presents you watch and you laugh but you don t expect to come out of the movie with a deeper message or something remotely philosophic to think about i find that when adam sandler tries to go deep his movies become quite depressing and nonsensical click quickly comes to mind the thing about the zohan is that i laughed a lot in some parts but i find his affairs with the older ladies to be a bit repetitive and leaning towards downright boring
also the crude language and the oh too much crotch view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie which is a pity because i find the hilarious fight scenes and the zohan s supernatural cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch second point of view would be from an arab point of view i started watching this movie preparing myself to get offended and mind you i am a very broad minded person
however i was pleasantly surprised for the first time in my life i see a movie that does not picture arabs as animal like heartless brainless killing machines
they are just people trying to make a living even the avenging one has a reason the zohan stole his goat watching this movie i tried to forget that i am an arab and i see that it is portraying in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way two opposing sides and suggesting that they stop fighting get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar the movie makers get my personal thank you for that it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between black and white people after the civil war or about americans and japanese directly after wwii there is no prejudices against arabs here for the very first time someone has discovered that arabs are human beings too
so thank you
man without a star has to be one film the former issur danielovitch must surely wish he could erase from his resume
douglas plays a ne er do well ranch hand who ends up switching sides during a range war among two big cattle ranches
jeanne crain is the boss lady of the ranch he starts out on and you can almost feel the beginnings of the big valley in this largely awful western from the s
outfitted in stylish form fitting shirts douglas is simply terrible as the conflicted cowpoke
talk about miscasting
crain isn t bad as the boss lady but she s no barbara stanwyck
a veritable army of familiar supporting players including jay c flippen can barely keep this turkey afloat
the script stinks the direction is aimless the cinematography is wasted
if this was the kind of movie intended to keep viewers away from their tvs i can t imagine it succeeded in doing so even though i understand it was a box office hit in its time
big wednesday endless summer
there is no real way to compare the two however since endless summer is a documentary that follows a couple of california surfers as they search out the perfect waves around the world
big wednesday is the story of guys as they come of age together and culminates in an actual big wave day that happened at malibu
the characters are guys almost any surfer from the late s and early s can relate to because of the bonding that would take place on the water
back then surfing wasn t about the big buck tournaments they have now it was time well spent with your compadres and the film reflected that time
remake this movie i hope not because it captured the essence of the california beach scene then and william katt gary busey and jan michael vincent portrayed very typical california surfers of the time and it would be almost impossible to capture that spirit again
it s simply one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is hard to believe people put money and agreed to participate in such a puerile film
this is a completely flawed after the end of the world film badly acted with cheap effects and a horrible filming
nothing to keep you watching it excepting the fascination of how worse it can get
and it gets worse as you watch it avoid it
on my personal scale
i just recently rented this title and it was great the story line contained issues from alcoholism marriage issues to the normal every day issues in the life of our great firefighters and the crazy things we do with our friends i know we ve all done a few of those here and there dj perry was awesome even considering this was his st starring role
a few times he was running in this movie i was waiting for him to fall flat on his face
he definitely kept it real
i would of been running my butt off if i was being chased by that hideous creature all i can say is great writing directing and acting go out and watch it
i have to agree
what a really awful movie
this was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren t as common as now sigh the original westworld takes a good concept and works well
the attempts to tie futureworld back to westworld are poorly structured wooden performances abound not just from the robots either watch westworld and skip the sequel another reasonable pick for an odd yul brenner movie is an odd post apocalyptic knife fighter flick aardvaark
hide and seek is a really creepy psychological thriller directed by john polson mission impossible ii the sum of us and it has one of the most memorable and most shocking surprising endings ever
another movie that had that creepy ending thing was wes craven s they
sorry no other titles come to mind
but see they it s extremely scary anyway robert deniro shark tale cape fear for once did not over act in this movie
his acting was actually great
and dakota fanning just literally blew me away
she is definitely the best young actress that has ever been and that will ever be i hope i said that phrase right but if i didn t i m sure you know what ii mean
she did the same thing in war of the worlds too
she has a very very very very very very very rare gift of acting
she has such a talent that god gave her
she just passed through the part easily as if there was nothing too it
her part as emily callaway really creeped me out
she also won an mtv movie award for best frightened performance in this movie
she really seemed actually frightened
everything else was wonderful in this movie
see hide and seek
you won t be disappointed original mpaa rating r frightening sequences and violencemy mpaa rating r violence terror and frightening sequences my canadian rating a violence frigtening scenes mature theme
again a french blockbuster
i had in mind largo winch for our national action thriller tries and the feeling that something was lacking in comparison to james bond mission impossible or the recent traitor my opinion hasn t changed action isn t unforgettable the story is boring and the characters dull even before the troubles come the spies are depressive mournful
i know the director wanted to show the crude reality of undercover action but he failed to tell something interesting
even his commentary is lethargic
it s a pity because some sequences show that he is talented with a camera
the best moment of the movie is their vacations in casablanca because it was almost like mine in oujda another moroccan town streets filled with people red and whites taxis pool and another french dvd without subtitles
i adore this movie
mike myers is a comic genius
i pretty much love all his movies but this one is one of the best
even before it was hysterical for eddie murphy to play his whole family we had mike playing his own father
and doing a darn good job of it too
hollywood insider films have been made since the movie colony came out to the west coast
the hollywood community was aware that the public knew their patented make believe was just that and so they were willing to share the truth about hollywood with the public fairly often but these films got darker in the late s and early s
in billy wilder s sunset boulevard showed how the world had forgotten it s celebrities and stars of the late silent period a generation earlier
in although ostensibly a comedy singing in the rain did show the disaster to so many silent careers even the detestable lila lamont s that sound brought in it s wake
yet with all the viewing of the effect of the film industry s changes on the lives of actors few tackled that of production people vincent minelli s the bad and the beautiful did just that studying the career of a super film producer
it s use of organized series of flashbacks reminds of that this film s producer was john houseman once the partner of orson welles in his mercury theater
the constant comment that the anti hero of the film jonathan shields kirk douglas is dismissed as a genius is like the disparagement shown to boy genius welles when he showed up in hollywood
but the basic model for the producer seems to be david o selznick whose father was prominent in the s until forced out by rivals in the industry
jonathan s father was also a big shot until he too was thrown out by his rivals briefly the plot of the story is how shields made a career out of the work of other people several of whom he hurt by discarding as soon as he could
first is his co producer director fred amiel barry sullivan whose treatment plan for a major film is taken from him by shields to sell the studio on backing it
amiel hoped to direct it but it is directed instead by von ellstein ivan triesaut a kind of clone of josef von sternberg
amiel breaks with shields as a result and never will work for him again
however amiel is able within a few years to be one of the most successful hollywood directors anyway that incident was in a film preview is shown at a theater showing anna karenina with garbo and fredric march an mgm film just like this one
in shields is casting the leading role for a film to be shot by harry whitfield leo g carroll possibly a clone of alfred hitchcock
he decides to hire georgia lorison lana turner for the female lead opposite gaucho gilbert roland
lorison is the daughter of a classic leading actor of the past his voice is heard it is louis calhern s who died impoverished and an alcoholic wreck the father and daughter are supposed to be john and diane barrymore
georgia is trying to keep off the sauce herself and falls on the day shooting is to begin
since jonathan learns that georgia loves him he romances her
it is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off rather roughly
georgia s performance makes her a success in hollywood but she never will work for jonathan again finally we have the story of novelist james lee barlow dick powell and his wife rosemary gloria grahame
barlow is in hollywood to write the screenplay version of his best selling novel of the deep south he s a clone for william faulkner and thomas wolfe with some f scott fitzgerald in
as rosemary keeps james lee from working jonathan tries to get the author into isolation to work and preoccupies rosemary with gaucho who had come onto her at a party
but gaucho and rosemary are killed in a plane crash
james lee finishes the script but an argument between jonathan and von ellstein causes the latter to quit the film
jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director
still he and james lee might work on a new project together but a stupid remark by jonathan causes james lee to realize that gaucho and rosemary were together on that ill fated trip due to jonathan
so he too leaves the producer
but subsequently he writes a novel about his wife and wins a pulitzer prize called together by jonathan s financial head harry pebble walter pidgeon the three victims of shields refuse a new offer for just one final picture with him
but at the conclusion they all show curiosity on just what the new idea of his is the bad and the beautiful had a wonderful script it has many intricate bits in it that one has to catch on repeated viewings
pebble originally shields boss dismisses him until he sees the treatment of the novel that amiel wrote he thinks it is shields ideas
he says in front of a seething fred amiel he always thought shields a genius
later of course he realizes it was not jonathan s work
similarly von ellstein congratulates jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director
later he too realizes it was fred s work and ironically the collapse of jonathan s position is begun when von ellstein lectures jonathan on how you can t just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one
also the first time georgia and james lee discuss a film script they accidentally by lack of knowledge on his part and by temporary failure of memory on hers hurt each other without realizing it
it becomes a rich tapestry of the industry and the various lives that get involved in it
as such it is one of the best films about movie making ever made
this has to be the worst film of the year
possibly of any year
doubly insulting that it s set in my home town
what was it supposed to be
satire
social commentary
a series of badly written sketches with no discernible story
how anyone can watch this codswallop and not find themselves screaming at the screen is beyond me
and to watch some decent actors struggle with this appalling script was agony i have to assume it was some sort of tax dodge for the scottish film industry
no one with any understanding and or experience of film making would surely sanction such utter tripe for creative reasons and the director wins a scottish bafta
who decided that
the same people who funded it perchance
it s no wonder no one outside of glasgow takes the scottish film industry seriously if this is perceived to be some sort of pinnacle
the only sensible thing would be to have a bonfire with all existing prints on calton hill beside edinburgh s original disgrace update i ve just read that this unspeakable piece of rubbish also won a british comedy award beating the incredibles and sideways
i think a steward s enquiry is required
update i ve since spoken to a couple of people who were involved in this production and they both reported that no one seemed to know what they were doing and boy does it show
the film made a mere at the uk box office i pray it wasn t released abroad great return on the k the uk film council wasted on it
it s no wonder they re desperately trying to recoup their investment via dvd sales and rental
makes you proud to be british doesn t it
update three not that i m obsessed
the comments of d g below are interesting
i m inferring that we in the vast majority and not just on this site who thought this film had all the artistic merit of raw sewage have somehow missed the point
it s apparently too much to ask of an alleged black comedy to have some er comedy in it
and the argument that it must be good because book club was doesn t wash either
if anything this debacle of a film has shown up griffin s remarkable paucity of talent
get real
i thought this was a great movie for fans of all ages
and i think dakota fanning is a sweet girl with an awesome acting future ahead of her
i think it was wonderful that they changed the role of the child from a boy to a girl just for her
she made this film made it work and made you believe
it s a feel good film
it teaches patience and perseverance
it shows kids and adults alike what can come from hard work
i thought it was a very inspiring film
made me remember what it was like to be a kid when everything was possible
see this movie you won t regret it unless you have a heart of stone
it made me treasure the moments between a father and a daughter having lost my dad this year
i miss him and i wish we d had a bonding moment like the ones in the film
and it was good to see kurt russell again
he s always been a favorite of mine
and now i can add another movie to my list of all time faves
his gal friday is howard hawks tribute to the brilliant play in which this film is based
charles mcgraw and ben hecht two of the best writers of the era paid tribute to the journalists that wrote for the american newspapers of the thirties
this movie has some of the fastest dialogs in memory the incredible combination of cary grant rosalind russell and ralph bellamy in the main roles is what made this movie a favorite
mr grant as walter burns the unscrupulous newspaper editor is the perfect foil for rosalind russell s hildy johnson a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions the best moment of the film is the moment when cary grant speaking so fast that some what he says goes over the viewer s heads refers as to ralph bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name archibald leach
it s hard to imagine anyone but cary grant and rosalind russell playing walter and hildy
ralph bellamy is perfect as hildy s fianc bruce baldwin
gene lockhart is perfect as the sheriff pinky hartwell
the ensemble of actors that play the reporters following the possible execution of earl williams are perfect an excellent comedy thanks to the genius of howard hawks
renoir s tale of paris the cancan a washer girl and the moulin rouge a more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the moulin rouge
jean gabin gives his usual excellent performance the technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisite an easy evening s viewing
chris w galla
i am surprised that so many viewers liked this movie
let me make myself clear i find the subject matter very interesting
trying to understand why people especially young people and even more so young girls become terrorists or freedom fighters the terminology is heavily dependent on your alliances is quite noble
so i was really eager to see the movie but unfortunately was disappointed beyond the normal expectations
what was good about it
well the actors were not too bad especially given the fact that they were mostly non professionals
that s about it
what was bad
let s start with the premise a girl freedom fighter terrorist becomes impregnated by a wounded brother in arms while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch and the latter are still raiding the area might i add
are you kidding me
i admit i ve never been shot in a battle so i cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade while the enemy soldiers are searching around would not be the first item on the list
well may be i am wrong here next who was in charge of the soundtrack and sound in general
this was probably the worst movie sound i ve ever heard the same bad composition played on a cheap synthesizer over and over so by the middle of the movie you have an urge to turn the sound off and just read the subtitles
who was the director
almost every scene with exception of the scenes involving the old man his goofy friend and the paralyzed wife looked exceptionally fake fights killings pull ups etc
anyways this could ve been a decent unprofessional movie but for a professional motion picture especially given the amount of positive coverage it falls quite short
i just finished watching the dvd of this first class semi screwball comedy in columbia classics beautiful transfer and it absolutely made my day
what a movie
what a screenplay
the dialogue is better more modern in fact than a in lot of contemporary movies
it s incredibly funny too and my teenage sons kept laughing right along with me at the smart come backs
cary grant is of course as good if not better than ever and i ve never seen rosalind russel in a role that suited her more perfectly
and that s just for starters the timing of the thing is still awe inspiring after sixty odd years the supporting actors down to the bit players are all memorable convincing and hilarious the camera work this is the forties though is inventive and the editing superb
i can safely confess now that i hadn t ever seen it before but that s no reason for you to make the same mistake go buy rent it now
hats off to the great howard hawks his cast and crew for pulling this comedy masterpiece off
and thank you thank you thank you columbia pictures formaking it possible for me to watch it in such pristine condition
i ve got the edition and from what i ve heard you should beware of earlier dvd issues
i can truly say this is one of the greatest movies i have seen in a long time
it made me laugh and cry numerous times
im not the usual crying type but this movie really moved me
i recommend it to everyone
this is truly a must see movie for the whole family to enjoy or for a romantic time with your spouse
director frank tashlin stretches his anything for a laugh method of comic film making to the breaking point with this very weak advertising send up with equally dull romantic confusion underpinnings
tony randall seems the wrong actor for the part of struggling ad rep rockwell hunter who gets a buxom beauty queen to shill for a new lipstick but at a price
it s supposed to be a riot but tashlin who also adapted the script from george axelrod s play can t seem to bring the material both farcial and cynical into a cohesive whole
it s full of prankish jokes and questionable taste but the episodic results are loud and forced instead of funny
there s a satirical promising opening sequence brightly prodding the tv commercials of the era but the movie steadily loses steam from there
from
a young woman who is a practicing satanist sets out to unearth the tomb of countess bathory by sacrificing young virginal women
waldemar daninsky paul naschy also used to be countess bathory s loyal servant when they were executed several hundred years earlier for their gruesome crimes
waldemar is now on a mission to destroy countess bathory in order to prevent her from making him her slave once again the craving when it was released in the states was horribly butchered because of its violent content
unfortunately this was its biggest detriment
it barely made any sense and was quite difficult to keep track of what was going on however i must say the climatic battle between daninsky and bathory was quite exciting and hilarious to watch any paul naschy fan should check out
fortunately it was re released under its uncut form via bci deimos a year or two back
just please avoid the censored version
it s way too confusing
this movie has a great soundtrack
the title song is pretty but the others used are outstanding
california which we hear whenever the hero goes after his old flame should be adopted by the state our hero is a top jingle writer for ad campaigns in new york with a desire to move up to movie scoring
this takes him to california which is where the college sweetheart who walked out on him now lives
he wants to relive the past with a happy ending
this movie will resonate with anyone who has old memories there are especially nice touches here about male friendship and intercommitment
james brooks seems to have done everything story music directing lead role and it does seem very personal
but this movie has a number of interesting elements in it
some bits about working with advertisers to produce a musical spot are marvelous
jimmy breslin has an interesting side role
there is a lot of warmth to this movie and don t forget the wonderful music
although cary grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy it seems criminal that irene dunne is almost forgotten these days
this is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period the other two are the even more insane divorce farce the awful truth from and s child adoption tearjerker penny serenade
with her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down to earth manner she is a wonderful screwball heroine even if she lacks the haughty glamour of katharine hepburn or the brazen beauty of carole lombard here dunne plays ellen wagstaff arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island
the problem is that her husband nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named bianca
further complications ensue when it s disclosed that ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic adonis named stephen burkett of course a bachelor
the ending is obvious from the beginning but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way in particular when ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool
in the same year he made classics like the philadelphia story and his girl friday grant is at the top of his game and dunne matches him every step of the way
it does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years but such was s hollywood convention randolph scott gamely plays the dumb as dirt stephen an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor s relationship with grant
as bianca the glamorously venomous gail patrick expert at such roles from classics like my man godfrey and stage door knows her fate in the movie but doesn t really show her talons until the courtroom scene
in scene stealing bits are granville bates as the frustrated judge and donald macbride as the confused hotel clerk
the only drawbacks are the overly precocious children played hammily by scotty beckett and mary lou harrington
directed with comic mastery by leo mccarey it s a frothy confection from a bygone era and the far inferior doris day remake only proves how unmatchable grant and dunne are
the dvd has a surprisingly pristine print transfer and extras include an unrelated comic short featuring humorist robert bentley and a condensed broadcast of the movie featuring grant and dunne
you really would think that no other film musical documentary could possibly top that s entertainment
come on it s got personal appearances by a host of stars and some of the most famous and best loved clips ever
including you know the singing in the rain bit from singin in the rain
could it get any better well that s entertainment ii certainly tries its darned hardest to be better
not a single clip is repeated from the first film in the trilogy and watching this film really makes you realise just how much talent was all focused in the one studio from the s through to the s
judy garland admiring fred astaire s easter bonnet in easter parade garland and astaire sailing up the avenue as a couple of swells in the same film gene kelly and garland dueting on for me and my gal ann miller and bob fosse in kiss me kate a montage of musicals before colour a garland tribute a spencer tracy katharine hepburn love fest this film unabashedly brings them all and much much more together
there are a couple of clunkers of course like bobby van hopping like a maniacal rabbit freak through the town or the token esther williams number
but as you listen to garland sing have yourself a merry little christmas or frank sinatra croon his way through i fall in love too easily and see gene tap dance on skates as naturally as if he had been born with them strapped on again you re struck with just how special an era this was in film making one that unfortunately is lost to the rest of us except through video and dvd and i know that this isn t the most popular of opinions but i think that s entertainment ii not only matches but far surpasses the original
there was nothing special about the first film its only gimmick was the coup it had managed in bringing all these glorious film legends back together to talk about their work
the only caveat was that the incredible personalities behind the stars just couldn t shine through except with some pretty special people otherwise they were all reading off a pre written script
kind of dampening really
that s entertainment ii on the other hand is a small but successful exercise in creativity from the title sequence through to gene kelly s direction of the new footage between himself and astaire
it s also a delight for fans of both astaire and kelly when these two dancing men you know dance together again
sure they re not as nimble and quicksilver as they used to be and some of the lyrics they re singing are well the only word for it is corny
but there s no denying that both these men have a kind of screen charisma that doesn t disappear with time and having them both onscreen together singing now that really is entertainment as it should be
in the final scene they tell us that the best films have the audience leaving the film with a glow
how right they are quite simply that s entertainment ii is sheer perfect nostalgia bottled and kept simmering just waiting for an audience
about the only flaw with it is that it simply couldn t be better than its source material but that s also what s so good about this film
it makes you want to go out and rent all the others and still watch it over again just to revel in astaire and kelly being onscreen together for the first time since the babbitt and the bromide in ziegfeld follies almost three decades ago what more could you ask for
i saw this one when i was in high school
i had been warned ahead of time but i liked classical music including grieg and ignored the warnings
i remember several things about it that really sum the film up in my opinion
the photography was stunning
snow fjords and norwegian towns and scenery were really pretty as were the folk costumes

grieg s music was nice to listen to though as in all films about composers they only give samplings those are the good parts
the bad parts were what sank the boat
there wasn t much of a story
greig s life wasn t as exciting as many other composers lives and a lot was padded to keep the story going for or hours
i remember a lot of overacting as well
but the worst part of all was the directing
forever emblazoned upon my memory is the hideously clich d scene where grieg his wife and someone else spread their arms and run across a green field stop on a hillock and spin around to face the audience
then they do the same thing again and again
if that s not enough to make you give up then nothing is
before i saw this film i read an interview with donnie yen where he said that he puts his blood and passion into everyshot
i think he was indeed very passionate about this film
while i don t think it is perfect it is a great stylished modern gun fu action film
hardcore action fans maybe bummed about the pace
i think it is just right the improvement from donnie s first two films is right on the screen
i do think his other films are good don t get me wrong
having recently seen princess blade on the big screen i think what i like about donnie yen s fight scenes is they are very much a part of the film
the fights come from a balenced sense of cinema and kung fu miramax needs to give donnie the budget and put him behind the camera on a high brow iron monkey
watching blasstic kiss should give them faith
this surprisingly primitive streamliner comedy from the roach studios with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid thirties hal roach decided to go into feature production first with films like the topper series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs including a murphy bed and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made it from scratch taxi fleet owners william bendix and joe sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility
the dialogue direction limps and although there are some good gags in the opening scenes including a music hating music critic and jack norton playing his usual fine comic drunk there isn t that much in the way of laughs to recommend this piece
this rather dark film noir with its uneasy comics roscoe ates nana bryant and billy house who even repeats his checkers trick from the stranger and desperate heroine mary beth hughes is further strengthened by the forceful performance of charles russell who manages to make his rather ambivalent drifter somewhat sympathetic
admittedly he is helped in this goal by the obnoxious loudmouth and light on brains mike who whether by accident or design is made even more repulsive than the screenplay requires by the over enthusiastic acting of dale belding
fortunately when the script gives her a chance mary beth hughes comes to the rescue with her animated portrait of the girl who wants to escape her small town prison in keeping with the nocturnal atmosphere of the radio series most of the action takes place at night
however although the picture is big on atmosphere despite its obviously limited budget it is somewhat deficient in characterization and motivation
the screenplay overstates the one dimensional comic interludes but dwells little on the forces that drive the main characters
why does russell murder the girl
is it an accident
self defense
the script hints at these factors
but why hint
and what is the background to this meeting
so many questions remain unanswered
this movie isn t that great at all but it s good when you want to just laugh because it s pretty ridiculous there are a lot of mistakes in it and it s cheesy
i got this movie for christmas like years ago but for some reason i ve never given it away
i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year
this is a very s movie so it s really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts
this movie is good for someone young although come to think of it i didn t even like it much when i was like but that s just my personal opinion
the movie was really predictable
i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy
i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallie s dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material
well it s friday the th and by the remake is so retarded jason is back but
he s retarded i m so sorry all of you jason fans but this just disappoints my butt the only thing that friday the th part deserved in media is a video game yes a video game now friday the th is classical s series in a creepy sorted of way now other series in the s like batman halloween and nightmare on elm stereet are s that don t lie i kind of enjoyed the new halloween derectied by rob zombie but this is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
hahaahahahahahah
next review superman returns sigend the angry video game nerd
i m not sure how to describe this bizarre but beautiful movie first it s long
just one minute under three hours
and it s not exactly fast paced either
if sci fi for you means action spaceships and interplanetary intrigue give this one a miss
in fact although the cover describes it as the cult bbc science fiction film i d hesitate to call it science fiction indeed i d hesitate to label it anything at all and it s definitely flawed
the dialogue is riddled with melodrama and pretentious poetry the camera work sophomoric and the editing clumsy
and yet the effect shines through the movie has an eerie otherworldly quality where trivial details such as an old lady glaring at a noisy conversation in a library seem to take on ominous significance and so if you have the patience you ll get sucked in to this movie
it s mysterious and beautiful
but don t expect to come out satisfied
although there is a plot it is far from clear
the story moves from one surreal incident to another each connected but seldom shedding any light on its predecessor even at the end when it appears that our protagonists have triumphed it s far from clear what exactly they ve triumphed over and most loose ends are left firmly untied hywel bennett does a fine job as as the somewhat petulant author caught up in a situation that might have been co written by kafka and philip k dick
dinah stabb perhaps succumbs a little to her melodramatic script dan o herlihy brings an artistic gravitas to his role
a cameo from a very young daniel day lewis and a supporting role by sting add a bit of celebrity interest overall artemis reminded me more than anything of twin peaks which was made nearly a decade later and curiously also featured dan o herlihy the same sense of explanation hidden just around the corner and another reality just half glimpsed and poorly understood
i don t think everyone will enjoy this movie but i certainly did
director star orson welles also adapted isak dinesen s rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in china who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich dying man his terrible wife and a sailor stud
the employee explains that this tale is just a legend but the millionaire aims to make it fact
the sexual implications in the narrative aren t ignored by welles though they are tip toed around probably due to the restrictions of and when welles as the old gentleman finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan it s hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle blonde a fine looking sailor and then offers him money
who needs jeanne moreau when these two are hitting it off so well
from
this is probably jean claude van damme at his sexiest
the best thing is that he s a prisoner and there s no suggestion that he was wrongfully imprisoned
he starts off as a bad boy but of course his tough exterior melts away to reveal his inner sentimentality when he meets a widow and her two children one of which is played by one of those hideous culkins
this is the first movie which is rayesque to the core one of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time the search for a father the relationship bogart derek is intense after the death of the biological one and predates those of run for cover john derek again playing opposite cagney and rebel without a cause remember plato to jim and judy i wish you could be my parents but i could also mention the mitchum kennedy relationship in lusty men or even heston and the chinese girl in days at peking or james mason and his biological this time in bigger than life emma s character predates the rayesque young girl the one you meet again in they live by night note how allene roberts resembles cathy o donnell allene roberts beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story like fritz lang nicholas ray put the blame on the society nick was born under a bad sign like many of the director s heroes john derek gives an intense performance climaxing in the scene in the court when his wife s suicide is revealed bogart shines as his lawyer he s more convincing in this kind of part than he was in marked woman excellent screenplay with a superb editing many contemporary movies such as the brilliant usual suspects might have been influenced by the first scenes note that the story begins during the cast and credits which shows that ray when he was on top of his game did not know filler
this was a poor movie with jack nicholson he is one on my favorite actors jack accepting to do a movie like this is a real dissapointment
why did he do it
a sharper script would have helped a lot the story line was very weak
this movie is good but disappointingly is nowhere near as good as the first airbud
the storyline is predictable and cheesey and you don t even see much of josh framm s legs
the hot teenage kevin zegers is the best thing in this movie michael aged
red corner was not only a good movie it kept me emotionally engaged for the entire film
i expected richard gere to do a good job he always does but bai ling stole the movie with a touching performance
red corner is very well directed too but from jon avnet who would expect anything else
producer jonathan shields is in big trouble on a production and reaches out to three people he s befriended and betrayed in the past for help
all three are brought to harry pebbel s office where he makes a pitch for the help of each one
and we re told in flashback the dynamics of the relationships between shields and each one one thing about tinseltown they ve never been afraid to show the seamier side of movie making
kirk douglas s jonathan shields is a not too thinly disguised version of david o selznick
the same drive the same ambition the same overwhelming ego that selznick was legendary for is a part that was tailor made for kirk douglas the three betrayed people director fred amiel barry sullivan star georgia lorrison lana turner and screenwriter james lee barlow dick powell all ring very true
one of the things i like about this film is that all three stories each in itself could be expanded into a film all it s own
lana turner s role as the ersatz diana barrymore is not to hard to spot either
it s so much better here than the film based on her own book too much too soon
if that voice of turner s actor father on those rpms she s playing sounds familiar it s that of louis calhern
turner s was a life lived out all too well in the tabloids and she brings all of it to bear in playing gerogia lorrison dick powell who was offered the lead as jonathan shields opted to play tweedy professor turned screenwriter james lee barlow
this was powell s next to last feature picture as an actor it should have been the one he went out on
powell was always ahead of the industry s cutting edge and he decided to concentrate more on directing and acting for the small screen powell s segment includes gloria grahame as his flirty wife
post world war ii hollywood whenever it had a part for a tramp first call gloria grahame
here she responds with an academy award winning performance
she hasn t many scenes but as was said in another mgm picture around that time what there is is cherce i don t think there s ever been an actor who can go from zero to sixty on the emotional scale as quickly as kirk douglas
check the scene when lana turner discovers how douglas betrayed her
the intensity of his reaction alone is frightening and real
douglas was also up for an oscar but it went that year to laconic gary cooper in high noon vincente minelli put all the pieces together just right and it comes out great entertainment
i made the mistake of renting this on pay per view while i was alone one night
the feeding might have been bearable with a crowd to make fun of it with but flying solo it was just excruciating
in addition to being dreadfully acted the characters and the script is simply imbecilic
i was especially irritated because the dumbest most volatile fool of the bunch the one who s stupid actions get i lost track of just how many people killed survives in the end
there are maybe one or two decent gore effects but overall they re as bad as everything else
oh and the monster suit wouldn t scare a kitten
but the nude scenes might
yikes
warning spoiler content
this movie is excellent right from the start it is clever quirky slick and really really funny
also to the trained eye it is packed full of so much symbolism that there is almost no scene where one cannot be found
the characters are clever and represented wonderfully by the people who play them especially rabbit you have to love that guy even if you find him a constant irritation the film would definitely not be complete without him
the storyline is nice well thought out and spreads the action out nicely over the length of the film
providing us the audience with a good dose of revenge humour irritation entertainment maybe even a little fear for the weak hearted and squeamish watchers and finally and a little unexpectedly the iron man la rocha having a sentimental moment at the end with his father the only thing that stopped this movie getting ten out of ten for me was the female lead she is a great actress and fit into the part really well i just find that her voice offends my hearing to such a degree that i can hardly bear to listen it really grates against the ears
other than that this is an amazing film i would recommend it to anyone looking for something that is not particularly scary but nonetheless highly entertaining
decades ago a crate filled with weapons grade plutonium crashes on an island and soaks into the ground
today a team of military men are sent to track down a notorious terrorist of ambiguous national origin and they track him to this polluted island
when their raft is destroyed the team must spend the night on shore but soon discover that the plutonium has done something awful to the island it has called forth hundreds of bloodthirsty velociraptors let me start this with a lesson don t lend a movie to your friend before you ve seen it especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet s finest horror movie site
it took me almost a year to get this film back and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it though we ended up seeing it together
and a second more important lesson when you do watch this keep your expectations as low as humanly possible
because this film ranks among the worst i ve ever seen my acting in th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film lorenzo lamas stephen bauer
line delivery is very fake and the words themselves are poorly scripted
the opening words come from a man checking out his gun s scope boom
dead bad guys yes that s pure genius at work
the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories
but it too seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time
we didn t need to know anything about their histories so why bore us with it
and if you think the conversations are bad you ain t seen nothing yet the lighting is atrocious
i generally don t notice lighting but my friend a former film school student was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors faces and the light would be in the background focused on nothing in particular
most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room and many of the scenes involve a deep subterranean cavern which you d then expect to be poorly lit but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles
don t ask me why the plot was pretty bad
some films can take the idea of military men chasing a terrorist and make a convincing film out of it
cat and mouse stories are riveting
well not here
the terrorist is really not even part of the story just an excuse to go to the island
and the raptors
and the allosaurus
sure they came from the plutonium that soaked into the ground
but if that makes sense to you please explain it to me because i have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction by far the worst part of raptor island is the animation of the raptors
that s right the selling point of the film is the worst aspect
the animation isn t just bad it s subpar
i can t even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy
and when they get shot
red splats like one would see in an old video game
even the airplane helicopter and navy ship are cartoons how hard is it to get a model plane
please don t see raptor island unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk
sure you probably want to see it before you see raptor island which seems to be getting better reviews
but just avoiding it entirely is your best bet
the closest thing i can compare it to is pinata survival island and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison
you have been warned
hitchcock comparisons abound with chabrol
however you may be hard pressed to see anything other than a superficial similarity between them here although nicely acted and crafted le boucher has a curious sense of disengagement that will either fascinate or frustrate viewers
while not necessarily a bad thing in itself this can also give the impression of a lack of depth
it s hard to fully discern what the character motivations are so depending on your proclivity you are likely to become either enthralled or disinterested in what they might actually be viewers familiar with francois truffaut will notice some similarities in approach but chabrol lacks the concise poetry of that other french great
even though the opening wedding sequence nicely sets up a scene of normality for the events that follow it s rather overlong and a more hitchcockian terseness would certainly have helped
still the film does have a strange charm and there are some excellent character ideas regarding the schoolteacher content with her celibacy long after a bad relationship being seduced
threatened
by the promise of new love from the local butcher who may or may not be a murderer
these threads are either unexplored or deliberately withheld depending on your point of view a worthwhile watch for those interested but possibly not quite the masterpiece some might lead you to believe it is
the rise and fall of comic lenny bruce dustin hoffman
bruce was one of the first comedians to use swearing in his act and was actually taken to court over it
the movie also chronicles his marriage to stripper honey harlow valerie perrine bob fosse was a strange choice to direct this he had only done two musicals before sweet charity and cabarat but cabaret was such a huge hit i guess he could pick and choose what he wanted
he shoots it in black and white and uses a documentary style approach by interviewing bruces wife mother and agent and then flashing to those scenes
it does work but the film is extremely depressing
the black and white is very stark and gives the film a cold look and feeling
also i found nothing funny in hoffman doing bruce s routines
it s not that he s bad he s actually very good but the tone of the film is not humorous as i said hoffman is good but perrine is spectacular
she gives a very strong nuanced performance
also she does an extremely erotic strip tease at the beginning of the film and holds her own in a mild lesbian scene it s worth catching but you ll probably be depressed by the end
if this film weren t such a downer it would probably be better known
in his life the john lennon story was a great movie but it could have been a little bit better
i was really impressed with how accurate it was
i thought it was a good drama of the beginning of the beatles however the movie was supposed to be a john lennon story not the story of the beatles
all this movie was was a quick story of how paul met john how john grew up la dee dah
don t get me wrong i thought it was absolutely wonderful that they actually showed all these important events in john s life but they didn t outline any of his later years
i suppose the directors of this movie wanted to do something a little bit different then the s john and yoko a love story besides that minor detail i loved this movie
i thought it was well acted out a treat to all audiences
it was on the nose accurate
and the actors who performed in it were absolutely wonderful
it almost made me feel like i was watching the real beatles
neon maniacs great movie by far one of my top greatest films the movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by water no then check this out i love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself
reasons jason goes to hell is the worst in a pretty good series of slasher films jason is not scary when he s on american casefiles i think that s what the america s most wanted like tv show was called
the whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings
putting him on tv sucks
so does having the fbi go after him he looks stupid in this one
that skin bubbling over the hockey mask is just dumb they try to put too much plot in it
come on it s a friday the th movie isn t it
forget this body hopping and hellbaby garbage and get the hell back in the woods jason
i thought i had written a review of this travesty of a movie there was absolutely nothing worthwhile in it
i agree with the last reviewer its too much nose candy they use a hand held camera to the extreme i have seen better hand held camera work on youtube the acting is second rate by a well known cast i will not insult them by naming them same for the director writer this was filmed on the beautiful cayman islands it should have been done on the santa monica beach that is how much it looked like the caymans rating out of points out of imdb out of
steven seagal returns in black dawn cool title i cannot say the same for the movie though it ranks as the worst seagal movie yet yes it is worse than out for a kill did we really need a sequel to the forigner that bad steven returns as jonathon cold assassin for hire this time he is out to stop a group of terrorists and prevent nuclier bomb from hitting los angelas with the help of cia agent tamara davies this idea seems okay the jonathon cold character once again gives the big guy a chance to tarnish his clean cut cinematic image you get the feeling with a decent director and production team this movie could have went somewhere if this cost million i wanna know where it was spent it was not spent on the movie
the action scenes are not bad the movie was obviously shot like a doug liman flick its just that most of the time seagal is doubled so much you cannot take the movie seriously whatsoever the script seems what script
logic is black dawned for a dozen low budget action movies seagal is not too bad here for a whole minutes he is engaging then goes about the sleepwalking that he has done for his last movies whoever is doing his fighting is doing a commendable job the light that shines through is tamara davies as cold s sidekick she has the chops skills looks and drive that give black dawn a little kick in the action department how she got in this movie is a riddle she should be a bigger star nicholas davidoff and john pyper feruson are not believable bad guys whose idea was it to make a sequel to a bad movie in the first place
it did not set the world on fire to my memory i can only hope they inject the next forigner sequel with some class imagination less stunt doubles and a livelier seagal if not then leave jonathon cold on ice
in what is said to be his landmark film buster keaton plays johnnie gray a train engineer in tennessee in
when war breaks out he decides to enlist but is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer
his girlfriend s father and brother believe him to be too afraid to enlist and his girlfriend refuses to speak to him until he is in uniform
a year later gray is engineering his train the general which is then stolen by northern spies and used to halt supplies to the south
gray pursues the train by handcar bicycle and engine car then after rescuing his girlfriend who was on the train the tables are reversed as the spies chase him gray on the general
pretty innovative comedy with great stuntwork by keaton including knocking away the railroad tie with another and a good feeling all around
keaton turns in an absolutely great performance with a great showing of slapstick sympathy and and romance
rating
robert harling took the liberties of directing this very good but sometimes misunderstood follow up to the classic shirley maclaine reprises her role as aurora and in my view is just as good and sometimes better in this performance then she was in the first movie
juliette lewis takes the role of melanie and in my opinion i thought she played the best character next to aurora because we have to remember that melanie is the only child that has never really known her mother so you can automatically feel the pain of the character
george newborn plays tommy and the character of tommy is in prison for what we don t really know
mackenzie astin plays teddy and is really the only child that is slightly happy and normal of the three this is years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later maybe a little more because melanie is pretty much grown up as well
it goes through what each of emma s kids have been through in those years and where they ended up
aurora s stress level with these kids is a record high she has one in jail one is pretty much a teenager who hates her guts and one is doing slightly well for himself but that doesn t help with the other two lol i also loved the story with aurora and rosie
i thought that was beautiful because even though rosie was the maid her and aurora were like family and when aurora was carrying rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life that was truly beautiful the story lines with jerry bill paxton and patsy miranda richardson is just purely for entertainment and laughter i especially like the airplane fight people are mixed reviewed on that fight but i laughed so hard but the emotion of the film like aurora making the photo albums her spreading rosie s ashes on the beach my favorite jack nicholson also makes a nice appearance and finally aurora s death
all of these elements make for a great movie and succeed people who write bad reviews or even mixed reviews probably don t understand the story good enough
this sequel was really not meant to be an exact copy of what the original was years before this which is why i think people looked at it differently
this is also why it went under a different name because it was the same characters but a completely different plot and story overall a movie that should be given more credit because it is just as good as the original
well by camera work i really mean all visual effects as well as the cinematography set design it s a visual treat
the effects used to dramatize bob mcconnell s sense of isolation and loneliness were intriguing also great acting by mr slater as usual
i like this guy s work it s nice to see william macy in a different type of role than i usually see him in but anyone could have done that turn not much there for him to do but he ably supports which is a fine thing since that s what his role here should be in some ways it reminded me of fight club saw this on an airplane today and now i m kicking back and looking it up
i quite enjoyed it
it s hard to put into words just how bad the acting is in this movie
i won t even get into the ridiculous psuedo plot because i can t get past the acting
i ve seen more talent in a play put on by kindergarteners and cats
watch this film if you ve been really bad and your priest is not available for confession
this is good for about a thousand hail marys
i completely understand the plot it goes like this girl without memory has face changed for some reason the police changed her memory she changed her face because she did a drug rip deal here brother likes to kill people who look like her actually she is a turkish terrorist jean reno is involved in something the turks kill another group of turks in a bath filled with mintthen it gets better the girl is a ninja the drugs are in an enormous cave filled with death people the case collapses and reno is death no he is not deathnever mind all that the end is amazing reno the cop the girl the brother all end up in turkey at the same time of course the whole france police force is also there the girl kills here father the cop reno and the police kill everyone else in the village the serial killer brother tries to serial kill the girlthe best thing about this movie however is the final end switch of dvd player throw disk in bin and sue the french for wasting your time movie seem to be made by a bunch of spaced out french with a high budget
awful just awful worst waste of time and money ever well there s french cars which are a step below that
charlie mackenzie myers is a san francisco coffee house poet whose poems are about all of his failed relationships with women and he s scared of commitment
things change when charlie meets harriet michaels travis a local butcher who isn t just beautiful but has a heart of gold their relationship is going great until he suspects harriet of being mrs x a woman who kills her husbands on their wedding night
his friend tony lapaglia thinks he s just being paranoid but the story reaches a climax when the real murderer is revealed and tries to kill charlie
the cast includes brenda fricker amanda plummer alan arkin and a cameo appearance by charles grodin
so i married an axe murderer is one of the funniest yet scary romantic comedies of
mike myers also plays the role of stuart mackenzie charlie s father
stars
sometimes you come across movies that are so bad and so full of overacting and mistakes they actually become hilarity
this is one of them i can live with the based on bit but i never knew it was the irish who were fed to a bull like monster that failed to scare even my year old son by some drug crazed nubians
i had greek mythologies back at school and although i do not remember much of it this was not part of the minotaur story
none the less never laughed so hard since bridget jones
any good comment you think
sure i liked the decors the costumes and basically the entire movie
it just parts ways with the original story and goes more the aliens predator tremors etc tour
thanks any way
this episode is the best i ve seen of this show it s so creepy i love it
when i watched it i was terrified and shaking all over
i was like feel his pulse feel his pulse
can t you see he s alive
and when they brought him to the morgue i was like oh my god they re gonna bury him alive it was almost out of my worst nightmare
i was so relieved when he started crying and the people noticed
my brother thought the episode was utterly boring
how could it be boring
my hart still starts thumping when i think about the episode
hichcock was so good
i haven t seen any of his movies yet except half of rear window in school but i ll watch the birds this weekend
i m sure it s great
beauty and the beast tells the story of belle an unusual but beautiful girl who goes in search of her inventor father and comes across a mysterious castle
she enters the castle in search of her father to discover it is occupied by a beast
she becomes his prisoner
the beast is loveless and thankless but she soon begins to fall in love with him and he with her
the film s end is happy satisfying and inspiring showing what the power of love can do beauty and the beast is a charming story of love and magic
it features lovely music
songs like beauty and the beast be our guest and belle are catchy and fun to listen to
it features first class characters the quirky belle gaston the hateful attractive villain the beast a character one can t help but feels sorry for the enchanted objects mrs potts cogsworth and lumiere characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie
beauty and the beast also features excellent executed animation
it isn t hard to tell all the talent the sweat and the heart that was put in this film
the ballroom sequence and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema beauty and the beast is great in another aspect it s ageless
although it appears to be a children oriented film it doesn t take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing
it s a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy when i first saw beauty and the beast i fell in love with it
it s a beautiful tale an engaging musical and wonderful fable of romance
one of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years it will go down in history with other beautiful disney masterpieces like snow white and the seven dwarfs fantasia and cinderella
i thought this was one of the better films i saw last year and i see a lot of films
it wasn t nominated for two spirit awards for nothing
if you ve never seen an artistic film i can understand why you might not like it
it s a smart film for smart people
with the film and the actors at first sight
i have seen it three times so far and will again
i had read the book many times before and was really amused at the faithfulness of the performances especially those of mr collins mr darcy miss bennet and mrs bennet
i laughed and was sad and angry together with the heroes
i really enjoyed the part where mr collins came to choose his future wife and the scene where mr darcy meets lizzie coming on foot through all the mud to inquire about her ill sister jane
in fact there is no scene that i would not like
i only missed two scenes from the end of the book
one was the walks and talks of lizzie and mr darcy after their engagement and second the reaction of mrs bennet after elizabeth told her about it the settings are beautiful
after seeing the english countryside in this film i found myself with a strong desire to visit britain again
one thing i really admired was colin firth s art to use his eyes to express mr darcy s feelings and facial expressions of jennifer ehle
i must say they did an excellent job in this film
thanks
after reading about this notorious film i finally managed to get my hands on it in some ways it lived up to my expectations but in several ways it did not the female acting was good male acting was bad the sound was bad but the music was superb and spooky although still quite disturbing and gripping the violence displayed was quite poor and very overrated and without giving anything away the supposed real footage at the end wasn t worth waiting for one reviewer even suggested that the footage was fake surprise surprise
i m glad i ve seen it just to say so but its not by far one of the most disturbing films i ve seen unfortunately if it did not have the end footage to sell the film i would say stay well clear nothing new but the fact that the film makers added this give it a go
fans of gore sites on the net will watch this film and think and
even copying other two great successful movies guess who s coming to dinner and meet the parents this one is really pathetic
all gags are old
every situation is predictable
characters are banal
an easy way to try to create a nice which nice is totally not in this case humor about the natural racial preventions which every race still fill in front of other races unfortunately
this movie sometimes makes you laugh most of the time is stupid and pathetic
technically this movie is very cheap many directors of comedy genre does not take care of a good cinematography etc
watch the dvd in your living room with your most ignorant friends and save some dollar
to go to the theater and watch this garbage is time wasted

i walked out of the film i paid dollars to watch one of the years worst comedies
the acting was horrid in the film
akshay kumars excessive crotch banging and sunil shetty s horrible portrayal of tucker from something about mary would make anyone wan to walk out
this is definitely the worst american remake ever
the songs weren t even original one was the beat of kevin littles hug me hug me and the other of jazzy b s dil lutiya
the best song would be the remix of chakle chakle thats it and it might be stolen too
i walked into the theater thinking this should be good because its the hera pheri cast but two hours into it i stopped hoping for something funny and original to come out
i say watch the film on dvd you might even think you ve wasted your money there
this movie really touched me
i can even say that it is the best movie i have ever seen
on the beginning you have a man with great enthusiasm then he gets more serious because of his job and his middle ages an then later
there are many unforgettable scenes
there is history love romance adventure psychology drama fun and everything
the scenario and the acting is perfect especially giulia sonia bergamasco and nicola luigi lo cascio
i was sad when the movie ended i could watch more hours
maybe this is a personal effect because of the wonderful scenario
anyway you can witness a complete life story from the beginning till the end
the director was very careful and attentive i haven t seen anything wrong
thanks to everybody worked on that movie
at the onset i should point out that i am not a fan of the films of cecil b demille
i have always found that although his films are impressive visually the dialog and acting is purely secondary at best
however the acting here is a little better than usual for demille raymond massey john wayne and ray milland are all fine
the only acting that really seemed poor was that of paulette goddard but this isn t surprising because histrionic and over the top performances of leading ladies is a demille trademark see anne baxter s performance in the ten commandments if you don t believe me generally this movie had a well written plot and it was both unusual and compelling
so because of a decent plot and better than expected acting this is already a pretty good demille film however when it comes to the action some things leave a bit to be desired
while to today s audiences the ship scenes will no doubt look pretty fake for they were pretty good and you could not see the sides of the pool in the underwater shots something all too common in underwater scenes of the day
so my big argument about the movie visually is the terrible action scene at the end involving the most fake looking giant squid ever seen on film
i can t imagine even in that people would have seen and believed this segment at all
in fact i would think they probably would have laughed themselves silly
so the overall product is a mixed bag
it is definitely entertaining reasonably well acted apart from some histrionics here and there and has fair special effect
it certainly is far from great but is worth your time
if you carry all of your sensibilities into the theatre with you will surely have them all crushed
this movie was made to make fun of itself its viewers and most others in between
they spare no one and it s beautiful the story would stand alone in the world of south park
the cracks the singing numbers m kay and the eyebrow raising humor just add to the enjoyment of the film since most of the jokes did not have the traditional set up punchline format i embarrassingly found myself being the only one in the theatre laughing through much of the movie best of all the movie really does present a relatively accurate microcosm of american ignorance and intolerance as well as the soon to be trademark humor of the next generation
the messages of the irony of american freedom of speech is also a focus of the movie if you could claim it to have focus
overall it was a funny abrasive comedy that will keep you laughing again and again this will be the movie i ll show my children when they get old enough to ask what was your childhood like daddy if they can handle it but i think we all know that by then they will be desensitized well past the extremes of this movie
as a son who grew up in a family of communists i found this movie very insightful the twists and turns of what fervent idealists took to be worker s paradise through the s s s and then to the end of the dream in the late s early s was very well portrayed especially with judy davis stalwart commitment which was portrayed quite sympathetically the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched as were her son s struggles with history both global and personal all in all a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic a genre it s very easy to screw up and is rarely if ever handled as deftly as it was here
in a time when made for television films from hbo in particular and showtime et al seem to be taking more chances with riskier topics than those flooding the theater screens along comes carry me home with a thud that hearkens back to the whiny tearjerkers of twenty years ago
while the premise of the story appears to be warm coming of age of a young girl with only a single mother to guide her growth the film fragments with so many subplots that are quickly and incautiously pasted together in the end resolving everything in a shallow overly sentimental and unsatisfying mess marlboro ny a time when the country is recovering from ww ii which includes the families of gis killed in the war and the economy in ruins
harriet penelope ann miller keeps together her household of two children carrie ashley rose orr and brian harrison chad by being a seamstress to the likes of mrs gortimer jane alexander a town gossip and matchmaker who is advising harriet to pay attention to the return of bernard david alan rasche as a potential marrying kind
harriet spends her days working and remembering her gi husband killed in the war
daughter carrie is approaching puberty and yet refuses to behave like a girl wearing her father s dogtags and jeans running instead with a group of boys including her younger brother and two other lads
the gang has a secret clubhouse make mischief taunt the mentally challenged neighbor charlie kevin anderson unfortunate son of grizzle leo burmester who abuses his unwanted son by forcing him to live in a barn
charlie s only friends are the puppies he treasures
the destructive pranks played on pathetic charlie include stealing one of his pups destroying the food garden of grizzle pouring sugar in the gas tank of grizzle s john deere tractor etc
in other words this little group of kids is cruel and their shenanigans are mean spirited harriet finds it impossible to control the behavior of carrie and quite out of keeping with the s family unit carrie sasses her mother viciously and in general is an unlikable brat
when bernard begins his courtship of harriet the prospect of harriet s finding a modicum of happiness is undermined by carrie s behavior
in a particularly cruel evening s prank grizzle s garden is destroyed charlie is reduced to self mutilation because of the stealing of his pup and the lowly barn in which he lives is destroyed by fire
grizzle and charlie survive and the effect of this final disaster on the lives of harriet and her children and their emotional awakening serves to make a hanky call and end the story with an unsatisfying bump the script by christopher fay is pedestrian leaving the film with poorly motivated characters about whom it is difficult to care
penelope ann miller tries her best to make the most out of harriet but ashley rose orr renders one of the least likable young girls on film
this is a black and white script without motivation
jace alexander directs which probably explains why his mother jane alexander consented to do the tiny walk on part to give the film attention
the crew manages to make the mood of america in the post war years plausible but the dialogue assigned to the characters undermines those attempts
there must be an audience for these soap opera films it is a shame this one couldn t have been better
grady harp
this is a well written piece by peter morgan author of stephen frears and helen mirren s the queen currently making the rounds of the theatres
director nick hamm is certainly not without a cv either
one unfortunate aspect of it all is the absolutely terrible title given the film in the us truly there is no excuse and it belies the mentality in that country as a romantic comedy of a sort it beats anything that ghost town hollywood be capable of there are elements here which won t be obvious to you on first viewing and that s to your advantage joey fiennes he talks like shakespeare
there s a least one scene where you expect him to blurt out oh i am fortune s fool this is refreshing and highly original and well worth a view
ourselves we saw it on the telly so we ll have to hunt it down as a rental or a purchase to benefit fully by it the charisma between fiennes and potter is palpable
as many say potter seems the blonde roberts but she s very much a match in talent as well
the conceit of this film a girl who has her back to the wall and nowhere to go and simply gets on a plane to go somewhere anywhere has very much the feel of other movies in the genre such as french kiss
it s a cathartic setup that works well and frankly joey fiennes has something his brother will never have definitely worth the view and possibly the purchase
the great mcgonigle ham actor extraordinaire cares for his troupe of performers in the old fashioned way thorough chicanery larceny skullduggery here is w c fields in all of his pompous vulgar glory evasive duplicitous sneaky utterly wonderful
delivering dialogue in his unique buzz saw rasp he gives out so many familiar lines that at times he almost seems to be performing a self parody
this film brilliantly shows why fields needed the sound cinema to let him be fully appreciated and with paramount giving him free rein to develop his material as he wished it is not surprising that the film is a classic
fans need look no further to find the essential fields the romance between judith allen joe morrison is a rather dull affair although the young man sings well
tammany young plays fields loyal amanuensis
movie mavens will recognize comedian billy bletcher as the tomato thrower sour visaged sheriff clarence wilson both uncredited
legend has it that hollywood s first movie star florence lawrence derelict forgotten made one of her last unbilled appearances here before her suicide fields found it useful to populate his films with at least one she dragon a female of frightful aspect against whom he could bounce off some of his best humor
this film has two rail thin nora cecil prim dour as the troupe s suspicious landlady and most especially silly jan duggan horridly bejeweled curled as field s wealthy target
here was an actress now nearly forgotten who could easily equal in hilarity even fields himself
it is generally overlooked how important her contribution is to the celebrated supper table scene with fields baby leroy one of the funniest sequences ever to appear in an american film
and her rendition of gathering up the shells on the seashore is a wonderful spoof of such sentimental songs as when you and i were young maggie which were so popular in that era
miss duggan would return to briefly plague fields in three additional films including the bank dick
she died in at the age of
fields has included the old melodrama the drunkard into the plot and to his credit he plays it straight letting its honest antique sentiment speak for itself
in his own private olio fields makes a curtain call to show off his astonishing talent of legerdemain
it is wonderful to have his routine captured on film as he really is quite amazing it is easy to see how at one time he was considered the world s greatest juggler
now he is remembered as one of cinema s supreme comics
when i sat down to watch this film i had a nagging doubt that daniel craig wouldn t be able to fill the shoes of his predecessors
sadly for him they forgot to make a bond film for him
the start was drab and low key with no bond music the opening seen was quite good but nothing new and the film then went from bad to worse
there were no good cars stunts women gadgets villains or exciting finishes
to add to this daniel looked awkward with the women and clearly has never played texas hold em before
this card game was the only real story a lucky win from m to m against
not really bond beating a world dominating villain
and finally bond is supposed to be cool and collected not a thuggish fighter a truly horrible film roll on clive owen and a decent plot
seeing it on cable
it was not very good
it s not really funny nor is it very entertaining
ben affleck is back to making the same boring bad acting films
rebecca romijn still looks good for her age but still has little screen presence
if she wants to act she should stick to tv roles
ling bai was ok she offers what little humor there is
also as for the story i don t buy that some fairly young good looking guy with a high powered job would be just ok with his hot wife cheating on him with a client
he wouldn t just take her back final verdict just another ben affleck disappointment
there s nothing in this film really worth watching
there is rarely a film i ever give a bad review on but in this case i ll make an exception
this film was truly horrendous
maybe i approached it in the wrong angle not at all used to the idealism of the s but this movie represented all that was horribly clich and unrealistic about high school and typical suburban life all the jokes were stereotypical whether it was making fun of the freshman geek or the chinese exchange student
the scenes that were supposed to be poignant and heart felt were instead mawkish and completely fake
who s to believe that a handsome high school senior disillusioned by the party life would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore
i couldn t even bring myself to feel sorry for the main character whose constant woe is me asides at the audience made me want to slap her and tell her to grow up in all a lot of eyerolling went on
i only watched it for some hope that the film would redeem itself
it ended on the worst note possible
okay i m speaking out of my hat here
i was only three when this aired and i don t remember having seen it but i do have the cast album and it is tremendously good i can only imagine what it must have been like to see edward villella dance
goulet and howe are perfect leads and tommy carlisle has a delightful tenor this must have been recorded for posterity
why on earth it isn t on dvd recreating it as a dance vehicle for semi singer gene kelly and non singer cyd charisse may have seemed like a good idea but this one needs a singer s treatment and the tv broadcast should be available whom do i write
city of ember isn t perfect but i personally enjoyed it and so did my family
i admit i haven t read the book but i am the sort of person who likes to judge adaptations on their own merits
the film does look phenomenal the set design is intricately crafted and the costumes are beautiful
and the special effects are mind blowing not the best special effects ever but not the worst far from it
the soundtrack is also rousing and fun the story is intriguing the script is decent and the acting is very well done
both harry treadaway and saoirse ronan the better of the two give appealing lead performances while amy catherine quinn is very cute as lina s little sister poppy
bill murray is deviously obnoxious as the slob of a mayor if there ever was one
however despite the impressive visuals and performances there are some problems
one is that while tim robbins is a good actor he is given little to do as doon s father
second the ending felt rather abrupt the film could ve done with a more rounded finish
thirdly the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half
this is probably not helped by the occasionally sluggish direction
despite these flaws i liked city of ember
bethany cox
paraphrasing from mark twain s foreword in the book huckleberry finn anyone trying to find a plot in this will be hung
anyone trying to find a moral will be shot this movie is meant to be enjoyed and not figured out surf the end of the trilogy was always playing at my house
this is one of my favorite movies
i like listening to this movie even if i am not in the room
i used to watch this movie and then play it again i compare this movie to cheech and chong and fast times at ridgemont high
i love this movie because of the dialog
every line makes me laugh
everything that is said is really silly
it s a slap stick kind of humor
i was when this movie came out
so i could relate to being a teenager partying girls and just being silly some of my favorite lines are one time i was surfing this foot tidal wave and what appears beside me i don t know
what what you mean you don t know
you were there beside me i know but i love to hear you tell it what s that noise it s the beach
never mind it s a great white i could go on and on but this is one of the best unknown movies
if you like this be sure to watch the search for one eye jimmy
this is another fine animated short from tex avery
this time he uses the fairy tale of little red riding hood
after the characters have complained they always have to play the same story over and over again the story is changed completely
the wolf is a rich character who falls in love with red
she doesn t want him because she has to go to her grandma
the wolf makes sure he gets there before red does
instead of a sick old woman he finds a mature lady who is attracted to the wolf
of course hilarious moments is what we get this short has a nice story and the usual tex avery humor including written messages
the short is not really suitable for children it has some sexual references but adults will like this very much
a very nice animated short
this is a rather enjoyable movie that is nothing too impressive but is a good watch nevertheless the movie begins slow and dull because it s mostly just so formulaic
from the beginning on it isn t clear which approach the movie picks and what the movie is all about
really no thriller elements in the first halve just some formulaic drama and romance
only halve way through the movie the movie starts to become interesting when the thriller elements of the movie start to appear in to the story
the movie is more thriller than it s film noir really which might be a surprising thing considering the time the year was made in
so yes in a way the movie is quite original despite being formulaic
it has a typical thriller build up that builds up that leads to the unavoidable ending
the movie has some good genre moments which mostly works out due to the fine cast and suitable atmosphere of the movie how often do we get to see humphrey bogart in the role of a psycho really
that is quite awesome
the supporting cast is also one to die for
barbara stanwyck was one of the leading ladies at the time and alexis smith was also quite popular
nigel bruce who everyone knows as the dr watson from the sherlock holmes movies starring basil rathbone also plays a quite amusing small role in the movie despite its genre clich s this is still a rather well made movie
it s effectively directed and the story flows well despite being quite silly at times
it s an above average movie due to how professionally it s made and how well the actors handle the script and its more silly clich s and unbelievable moments
perfectly watchable movie especially for the bogart fans who want to see him in a role that is different
purple plain is an obscure film in peck s long list of movie credits
i don t know if this british production got much publicity or release stateside despite peck s movie star celebrity
unfortunately it s never been a tv regular which is too bad because this tale of renewal and survival is an unusual and gripping one in spite of the obscurity the film opens in the burmese jungle during wwii
peck is a battle fatigued flyer on the ragged edge of breakdown
he s about to be relieved because of erratic behavior all the while he s flashing back on his wife s death in a london air raid
these are well done scenes causing us to sympathize with his loss
nonetheless he s jeopardizing his comrades with reckless manuevers because the loss has undermined his will to live
thus we re torn between sympathy and concern just like the flight station doctor bernard lee in an interesting move lee overcomes peck s agonies by reconnecting him socially in this case with a nearby missionary community
there peck finds the vital human relationships so importantly missing from his death dealing combat duties
as a result his life takes on new meaning and purpose as a result of rejoining a human community where such life giving affirmations can emerge
on the whole these are well done scenes especially the chaos from the japanese air attack
in the midst of the carnage peck s combat flyer finds a new role in helping to bandage up survivors
herein lies the movie s basic message and it s an important and humane one conveyed in fairly subtle fashion though the turn around occurs more quickly than i would have liked nonetheless it s interesting that the script avoids the usual officially sanctioned head doctor therapies
note that peck is not sent to be counseled by an air force psychiatrist nor to join a chest baring therapy group nor to have his past puzzled together freudian style
of course the happy solution here remains a movie solution where as we all know anything can be made to magically happen
still for a war movie setting the simple affirmation that mental health lies through nurturing social relations and not through government sanctioned killing remains no less suggestive because of its movie origins the remainder of the film amounts to a survival trek through the wilds of southeast asia
it s a well filmed and harrowing struggle against a forbidding landscape where the crash survivors must decide between staying put or hiking out against great odds
but most importantly it s peck s chance to regain his humanity by facing up to the odds not just for his own survival but for his two comrades as well
the movie s final scene could not have been better conceived
indeed no words are necessary
on the whole this is a subtly and well thought out anti war film no less effective because it concerns the fate of one man rather than thousands too bad that its humane message remains so generally unseen
is a highlight of this short but snappy soaper
irene dunne great as usual plays an ambitious woman who pushed husband charles bickford to partner with friend eric linden to create successful business
but bickford has a yen for babes and links up with a conniving one gwili andre who pressures him to get a divorce
film culminates in nasty divorce led by hateful lawyer j carroll naish
somehow this all works even tho is pretty far fetched
chalk up another success for irene dunne
reviewed by elliot v kotek from hatchfest in bozeman montana director kirsten sheridan starring freddie highmore keri russell jonathan rhys meyers jamia simone nash marian seldes robin williams if you ve ever questioned the impact of music on emotion august rush is a must see that will bury any doubt for all time
featuring jonathan rhys meyers as rock star louis and keri russell as new york philharmonic cellist layla and starring finding neverland s heartbreak kid freddie highmore rush delivers an experience that borders on the sublime and somewhat sentimental in a manner that rivals neverland and would be reminiscent of titanic if that ship had not sunk
a stirring performance here by russell will definitely remind end of year voters of her work in waitress and should serve to solidify her chances for an oscar nom the premise a promising musician russell is impregnated by a brooding but romantic irishman rhys meyers in a one night affair overlooking washington square park that will change the course of their lives
despite splinters of wooden dialogue and the obvious yet ultimately satisfying use of the music of van morrison early in the proceedings the movie moves past both and bowls audiences over with poignant performances and stunning visuals in a first class production
layla s protective father falsely informs his daughter that her love child did not survive birth and delivers the boy evan to the state where the influence of all sounds great and small fill the boy with musical ambition and intuition in addition to the above the liners already singled out robin williams wows in a blinding turn as wizard a menacing fagin whose oliver twists are young homeless musical prodigies and whose milk cart careers he manages in exchange for their daily take and a fancy stage name
onto the young evan he bestows the moniker august rush inspired by a passing grocery van
director sheridan jim s daughter kirsten keeps the reins on her comic wizard and williams seems to subtly straddle the line between sympathetic and psychotic
also more than merely noteworthy is jamia nash an year old with some of the best lines of the flick who boasts a healthy dose of moxie that provides the perfect counterbalance to some of the heavier themes that accompany a film about an orphan searching for parents he isn t sure exist while the genesis of the film may have started with producer richard barton lewis s vision of his then newborn son s little digits directing his own symphony in a santa monica delivery room the screening of this film is sure to inspire many more digits to pick up and pick at a six string just to see what happens
here s hoping studio support for the film will see screens increase after opening to take advantage of what should be great word of mouth
with screenings set for the upcoming heartland film festival where the film has been branded with a crystal heart award the rome film festival and elsewhere this moving tale is sure to find itself a fixture with families worldwide
a rural texas town finds itself beset by a series of mysterious disappearances and deaths with no seemingly rational explanation
the local sheriff is faced with an angry community leader demanding an end to the matter or his resignation
through the combined efforts of the sheriff and a quick witted mechanic the source of the problem is discovered a fifty foot gila monster who has run out of food and is now preying upon the local populace according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis god s unexplored wilderness aka texas as shown in the film s beginning includes no sign of food so it s only natural to have its giant gila monster leave
it starts off by eating two tasty teenagers who are trying to enjoy some submarine races
the director ray kellogg seems to have a thing for actors putting their legs up somewhere
watch for both hero don sullivan as chase and sheriff fred graham as jeff to put their legs up together in the auto mechanic shop compton s garage the characterizations are interesting
sullivan is an older influence on the younger and more rebellious gang of teenagers and he has turned from hot rodder to auto mechanic
he is supporting his mother and crippled little sister
sullivan also sings well although his choice of material definitely does not rock
not as much is revealed about mr graham s character but he is refreshingly non confrontational with the younger cast members the movie is at least two legs up over awful and is fun to watch with friends the giant gila monster ray kellogg don sullivan fred graham shug fisher
a sci fi comedy
nah that ll never work that s what many people originally thought about the comedy classic red dwarf when the idea was first brought up in the mid s
but little did they know it would be so unexpectedly successful that it would actually have a cult following from all over the world the brain child of rob grant and doug naylor red dwarf is unlike any other comedy
it has a unique british humour and its sprinkled with dry wit and hilarious one liners but any fans of this show will know that there s something more to red dwarf than any other comedy ever made the characters are the most mis matched bunch of low lifes in the cosmos but put them together and they work perfectly
rimmer the most misunderstood man in the universe
perhaps but its more likely he s just a great big jerk
he has no redeeming qualities what so ever and yet it s impossible not to love him lister space scum
barely human slob
absolutely hilarious
the last man alive and he can t even microwave his own socks
cat whose main traits are vanity stupidity and well vanity cat cares only for himself and finds his crew mates disgusting kryten where would the crew be without the humanoid kryten
i absolutely love this show and have seen all seasons several times and i plan to watch them many times more
watching red dwarf not only makes the viewer laugh but the characters are so likable that watching it gives a deeper form of entertainment because the characters almost become like friends
the characters and actors do make this show who could imagine anyone as rimmer other than chris barrie
or a better lister than craig charles
the writing is truly very clever and incredibly unique with subtle jokes as well as obvious rip offs and hundreds of hilarious one liners this is one amazing fantastically unique show that will never be equalled
this is my second favorite movie behind maximum overdrive
it just so happens that both movies are from
the wraith has great cars great music great racing action decent actors
too bad that most viewers of this movie will see it cut up on tv but if you hurry you can get it on vhs or dvd like i did
this movie starts with a lot of promise
the opening scene featuring sean connery is very entertaining
however connery disappears for most of the rest of the movie along with any talent that anyone else may have exhibited
the movie jumps from place to place with no coherent story
there is no sense of time
the editing is laughable
after the first minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film
this is a little gem for those wanting a bit of relaxed entertainment
unfortunately it came in a period when kelly donen were setting a new standard for big production and very rapid pacing so it was out of fashion and ignored
everyone is charming marge and gower champion are at their peak bob fosse is just hitting his stride amusing that his screen persona was so charmingly little boyish in contrast to the dark angular sexiness of his later stage choreographies and debbie reynolds is pixie ish as ever
helen wood was not a great actress but she was necessary to provide an additional dance flavor see below to differ from another reviewer i think that kurt kaznar was perfect for the leo belney part at least as it was written
he carries off being totally suggestible changing opinion instantly and having an equal conviction in each new attitude though they don t make a big deal about it the film was mirroring a real conundrum facing broadway directors at that period what kind of dance to use
tap was still around but on its way out a kind of jazz ballet blend was becoming mainstream the avant garde was a more dramatic and angular modern dance
which would the public go for in the next show
to be humorous on a low budget feature is often a very difficult task
to blend humor and horror is an even more arduous task
but director steve cuden does so with such imagination and creativity
with a feature that can best be described as daring cuden has created a jet black comedy that will chill you
with great performances and a distinct visual style this hybrid film will thoroughly entertain and sit up and beg for repeat viewings
definitely check this film out
it s always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens
my film crazy friends and i habitually did this in our college days
long years later the thrill has not worn off
this time the film i lined up to watch at its first screening in town is eklavya the royal bodyguard
vidhu vinod chopra the filmmaker who in the capacity of either director or producer gave us parinda mission kashmir parineeta and the two wonderful munna bhai movies was unveiling his new directorial effort and i was eager to see what lay in store eklavya boasts a huge cast of eminent actors how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time
the glittering line up features amitabh bachchan in the title role along with chopra regulars saif ali khan sunjay dutt the exquisite vidya balan boman irani parikshat sahni jackie shroff jimmy sher gill raima sen and an elegant cameo by sharmila tagore the film opens with the unmistakable voice of amitabh bachchan narrating the legend of eklavya from the hindu epic the mahabharata
eklavya a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of dronacharya the instructor of kings
contemptuous of his low birth dronacharya refuses to accept eklavya as a student
undeterred eklavya builds a clay effigy of dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it
soon after dronacharya is taken aback by eklavya s proficiency which has outstripped that of his princely pupils
as it wouldn t do for this commoner s skills to rival those of the royalty the crafty dronacharya demands a dakshina or teacher s fee from eklavya
whatever you wish the devoted lad replies
your right thumb that is what i want as my dakshina commands dronacharya
without hesitation eklavya slices off the thumb knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery
the story is meant to illustrate the notion of dharma or the fulfillment of one s sacred duty in any circumstance regardless of cost
off screen the child to whom amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome and his shrill tones are the voice of reason amitabh like his dutiful namesake eklavya is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in rajasthan
despite the family s tyrannical ways he unswervingly stands by them
the film unfolds in the present but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory entitlement and unquestioned power
their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless and the worm is about to turn the queen mother s sharmila tagore deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque overwrought plot in motion
the heir apparent saif ali khan who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives is summoned home for her funeral
before breathing her last the queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans
this confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross intrigue and counter intrigue the film has the look and feel of a stately epic but vidhu vinod chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics
there is a business like economy in his approach
there is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse
he appears to say that was then in the past there s no time for that let s simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now
voice overs and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present
the pace is breathless as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation
every now and then there is a moment of stillness which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored
an effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in hamlet and the wraith despite no lines to declaim has similar impact amitabh bachchan s magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot
saif ali khan impresses yet again there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience
unlike parineeta vidya balan doesn t have a whole lot to do here but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince
boman irani an actor of sweeping range and intelligence is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe eyed ambiguity while jackie shroff and jimmy sher gill as the wicked uncle and cousin handle the villainy with lip smacking gusto
sunjay dutt fresh off his munnabhai success is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty
what a pleasure it is to see sharmila tagore who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years eklavya displays a most un indian efficiency in film making terms at least and speed a mere minutes in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters
it would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floor perhaps the dvd will have the deleted scenes
music is used appropriately there is a lone song of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen
the cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous rajasthani terrain with its pitiless crags and sun scorched sands
clearly vidhu vinod chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film and glowing endorsements from the likes of ralph fiennes enhance his chances
here s to you mr chopra and more power to you
black robe released with poor timing in the aftermath of a similar themed film kevin costner s dances with wolves black robe largely got lost in the shuffle
that s a shame because the film is actually quite remarkable
not to say that it hasn t had influence on other films however
black robe certainly must have had quite an influence on terrence malick and his the new world
the title credits are clearly inspired by those in black robe and other aspects are familiar as well set in th century quebec the film follows a young jesuit priest father lafourgue bluteau referred to as black robe by the natives
he travels with a band algonquins lead by chomina schellenberg
with father lafourgue is daniel a young frenchman who is in love with chomina s daughter
the young priest soon begins to inspire fears that he is some sort of demon and many in the band wish to leave him behind or possibly even kill him and his companion their travels meet turmoil among other hostile native tribes leading not only a struggle between peoples but a struggle between faiths
beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere using the cold quebec landscape as an intimidating but still beautiful backdrop
the weather feels cold the air crisp
it s really quite a beautiful film to look at bruce moore who wrote the screenplay and the novel it was based on went to great lengths in research to accurately portray this period in time
many have praised the film for its accuracies while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages
i have to disagree
neither side is shown as total bad guys nor total good guys
the film gives everyone a fair shake
both sides have had their reasons and both sides committed terrible acts
certainly not all natives were all about peace and love which is not a slight to them in the least
their history is a noble one and they had every right to fear and be hostile in the face of europeans
that said i m probably overcompensating for the film because it really doesn t show natives as savages at all especially not the algonquins
moore claimed in fact that he actually toned down the violence of the natives compared to what he found in his research
that said what he found in his research was most likely overstated to begin with black robe certainly is a bleak picture
the naturalistic photography and tone adds to the depressed atmosphere
this is not a story of joys but of sorrows
when the film ends we are told what history has already told us the natives were slaughtered and the jesuit s mission by and large was a futile failure though the film sticks to its own dark history this is more than just a very well done history lesson
black robe is a parable of the horrifying results that come from misunderstanding miscommunication and ignorance
while the jesuit mission was well intentioned it was more a product of eurocentric ignorance than anything else
the native people had their own religious beliefs and the film shows that
the lessons in black robe are transferable to any number of modern day conflicts
we have not learned our lesson and by removing the gloss and glamour off the period epics of old black robe serves as a reminder
such a shame its so overlooked
film about a rebel rouser in a run down hospital for disabled kids
imagine one flew over the cuckoo s nest from a snotty kid s perspective and you have this mess of a film
direction script acting and just about every other form of input in this film is stilted and weak
the fact that spacey spent his time on this film is truly disheartening good thing is that you realize that no matter how great an actor one maybe direction and script are very important
do not watch unless you want a reason to put your fist through the television
this film atrocity must be seen to be believed
by comparison plan looks like citizen kane
any movie that can combine vampires space travel lobster men bat pygmies snake men cavemen into one utterly illogical incomprehensible plot gets a special place in my bad movie lovin heart to begin with
when compounded by adding tinted black white stock footage as a plot device a cent plastic toy spaceship with a bic lighter for propulsion i swear i m not making this up and a spectum analyzer that is clearly a caulk gun it transcends the normally accepted standard of so bad it s good
the worst of the worst
i hated this movie
don t know why i even finished watching it
oh yeah i remember jason momoa was nice to look at it moved slowly
stupid story
bad acting
way too sappy
i didn t feel any compassion or connection to any of the characters except maybe kala jason momoa
a dumb too easy ending i had a big prob with the age discrepancy
momoa madsen are actually
however momoa s character kala has a yo son who lives with his ex wife
i think that would be biologically impossible
ok he actually looks older than and his character behaved more maturely than emma madsen
the character he played must have been much older than the actor really is but imho not much older than
that would mean he had his son at
ok that s biologically possible but married too at that age this movie was suppose to be about a married woman being tempted by a younger man
jason momoa is very sexy and sensual
who wouldn t be tempted
so where were the hot steamy love scenes
there was some kissing but i never felt any heat between them
besides jason momoa the only other thing good about this movie was the beautiful hawaiian location i rate it out of
like all of dennis potter s work this shows us what film could should be
it wakens all the old dormant brain cells
yes imagination inspiration do still live are still the main ingredients of real art
not necessarily compatible with democracy tho maybe who knows
this is just another one in a long line of teenage high school films we saw last few years
it tries to be funny and cool but it fails everywhere first of all i didn t care liz died in the beginning
why
i didn t know her
wouldn t it be better if the writer director put a few scenes with her in it in the beginning of the film
not just that walking through the hallway stuff
second didn t anybody on that school notice fern was gone
wasn t there a teacher who would check this third pam grier deserved a bigger part in this one fourth rose mcgowan s character is so unbelievable it s almost laughable fifth advice look another film
when i saw the film at indie gathering i was absolutely floored i sat in my seat absorbing all that i could
the progression of the character was a thing of desire because it wasn t a traditional love story or good verses evil it was a well thought out script that had twisted and turns and ups and downs but it made you want to watch more and more
peter s performance was just amazing and my hat goes off to him
it was very noticeable that he loved the character and made it his own
thanks for the great film and i look forward to seeing of arc and other projects that robert has up his sleeve derrick mullins
this has to be one of the best shows ever made
i ve never laughed at a show as much as this
dodgey sets acting and scripts with some of the funniest one liners that would make bruce campbell fell proud
and this is only after the fist episodes
i wanted to try this film because of franco nero and menahem golan
but damn who casted shane perdue
he could be good looking if he didn t look so retarded all the time
but acting wasn t one of his skills either
as of the rest of the acting crew even franco didn t do much about his character
to be honest i think steven bauer did the best of acting
he didn t deliver much beside scarface either
really somebody tell me why is this film made
it s terrible
i really hope people read all these comments before considering watching it
and you actors out there please deliver more into your character
and you writers out there go get inspired please don t see this film
it s not worth it
this is an odd film and i don t mean this in a negative way
all too often films seem derivative and predictable though this film excels in being different and placing gregory peck in a very unusual role that of a fighter bomber pilot fighting for the british empire during wwii
while i loved the film because it featured nice aerial shots of the de havilland mosquito the plane it was not really a film about dogfights and bombing missions but was instead a character study of peck as he tries to survive and keep his injured comrade alive
at times the film uses some flashbacks but generally it is a straight drama about how the crash of his plane impacts him and gets him to reassess his life different and a film that allows this wonderful actor to exert his acting muscles
i realize i m taking on an icon here but honestly this is the most disgustingly boring and over rated film to come out of the s
it is unfortunate that the rather pathetic woody allen an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses
even more unfortunate is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the western world to agree with him
frankly it does not speak well of our culture this yawn movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers a neurotic new york comedian alvy singer played by woody and a would be singer annie hall
the two both in analysis move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional paid for navel gazing
i certainly wouldn t want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex
the rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here annie hall is played by diane keaton an actress who is actually very competent
her movies are frequently not my favorite though i did enjoy the cute baby boom
her only memorable aspect in this film is her ralph lauren clothes now of course quite dated which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time
that classic comment of woody s regarding sex this is the most fun i ve had without laughing doesn t particularly impress me with its brilliance
fear not shakespeare woody serves as no threat to you as master of the english language
it is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless uninspiring unoriginal and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on mount olympus annie hall isn t the absolute worst movie i ve ever seen but it really doesn t have much to recommend it
i normally adore romances but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest
furthermore the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me
back in when i saw this movie at the theatre with my husband then boyfriend we both sincerely wished we d found some paint and watched it dry instead
i guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate
this movie was almost unwatchable the only thing that keeps you from banging your head against the remote is that you want to see the were crocodile for the laugh itself
it had the clich token black guy in the pacific northwest
yea
we ll stay away from there then lol with the farmer s daughter white girl
they can never act either they just have to be black and half the time they can t even pull that off see get rich or die trying for an example he couldn t even play himself convincingly of course all the typical stuff is here but in bad taste
lakes woods naked chicks pot camping full moons about the only thing they missed was rain
garbage
you know that one guy who d do anything to get you fired destroy your house alienate you from your friends and family chew through your surge protector
you know the usual
well imagine if that guy was a poodle sized sewer rat i wondered going into this movie why peter weller would agree to star in what is essentially the rat equivalent of jaws the revenge
i got my answer about twenty seconds into the film where it opens on a shot of shannon tweed playing weller s wife here showering
umm okay she leaves along with weller s extremely dimwitted kid to stay at a hotel only to pop up later in the movie scantily clad back in her hotel or in a dream sequence in order to meet some strange s boob quota i suppose weller is doing fine by himself staying behind to finish some work until the dishwasher overflows eventually upsetting a rat who decides to move into his apartment
its hard to gauge just how big this thing is supposed to be until it decides to crawl up under the covers in weller s bed later apparently he s the size of a tomcat weller does his best to get rid of the rat upgrading from normal rat traps to what are basically miniature bear traps
when the medieval rat traps don t work or come back gnawed on he decides to get a cat which also comes back gnawed on or replaced with a cheap stuffed animal that resembles his cat
when he decides to ignore the rat he chews on on his surge protector fuse box and therein cutting off the power weller runs around the house bashing holes into walls in search of the rat is plagued by nightmares of birthday parties where the giant rat jumps out of a sheet cake
and where his dimwitted kid ends up mixing in various rat poisons in with his cereal
the finale brought to mind arachnophobia as it ended in a dank basement the film ending maybe twelve seconds after the rat s been dispatched as weller brushes himself off as if the last two hours hadn t just happened just in time to greet his wife and kid at the front door
i m sure they won t notice the completely demolished apartment
i don t believe people are giving this movie the benefit of the doubt because it seems simplistic compared to the peter jackson extravaganzas
what people also have to remember is that unlike the jackson renditions this and the hobbit were made especially for children
the characters designs and the story itself have to be toned down so that children or stoners can follow the story without becoming too freaked out by orcs roddy mcdowall is pretty much the most hilarious sounding samwise ever and the character design fits him perfectly and both elements create a character of great vulnerability
for a rings movie this short we are still able to sympathize with sam
this is not just because of the well compressed storyline but because the design for both frodo and sam is just so cute
they look like a cross between puppies and elves
and that s cute i recommend this to anyone with an open mind about an alternate version to the final chapter
it won t really ruin the story for you it ll just show how this story was made into a film before the use of cgi and before movie studios started puking money at jackson
i thought ichi the killer and oldboy were interestingly weird films so i rented three extremes on the basis of what i knew about miike and park
i figured that if fruit chan was notorious enough to be included in an anthology with those two directors his contribution would more than hold its own well the results were worth seeing once
dumplings was both the most revolting and the most socially savvy of the stories box displayed the deepest emotions in a tale of loneliness and despair disguised as a ghost story and cut was the most overtly gruesome and had the most gimmicky and contrived plot since i am unfamiliar with chan s work i can t say whether he stretched himself or tried anything new but i do think that the acting and direction here were the most subtle and complex in the trilogy
park s stuff seemed very much of a piece with his previous tales of violence and hitchcockian entrapment that drive the protagonist to despair
but miike surprised me since box was entirely different in tone and structure from his famous film ichi and i wasn t expecting anything like this from him
box is more of a waking dream such as lynch would do in lost highway or mulholland drive and i thought some of the dialog and photography were most impressive
good for you miike you re even smarter than i thought
as anthology films go this was pretty good although nothing that anyone will remember in a decade
worth getting or at least renting if you are a fan of any of the directors or if you want to see something relatively fresh from cultures whose clich s and conventions haven t worn out their welcome in the occident at least not yet note about the dvd edition i saw the nd disc in the package offers a feature length version of the chan story dumplings
the additional footage is very well integrated into the original and this long version gives the aunt mei character and the philandering husband more screen time and adds an extra sex scene
but it doesn t change the real thrust of the original story enough to make it a must see unless you really dug aunt mei
if the only dvd you can find is a bare bones edition without the feature length version don t worry that you ve missed anything vital
despite the title this film is not about a crime wave
that s just a catchy title to start you wondering
it is about a reformed ex convict well played by gene nelson being pressured by some escaped cons to assist them thus endangering his parole and threatening his wife ably portrayed by phyllis kirk
the film is dominated by the massive six foot five noir star sterling hayden as a tough homicide cop who chews toothpicks non stop because his doctors won t let him smoke and who says things like you re head s full of mush
it s always good to see sterling hayden again the more times he turns up the better he s solid he s menacing and what is more he s the real thing
you know he d knock you down and then pick you up again and besides he s compulsively watchable
in his eyes there is always that half mad flicker and that ain t acting
the film is directed with superb applomb by the highly professional andre de toth lucky spouse of the delicious veronica lake and he never wasted a frame
there are numerous fine touches sterling hayden picks up a murdered cop s hat and puts it in the ambulance beside his corpse but he does this as as afterthought without calling attention to the gesture
in one scene a crowd of extras stand on the far side of the street watching a police raid
toth allows them merely to be glimpsed
toth does not signal and linger he moves on he has the confidence and control not to worry
there is lots of los angeles as it was in in this film released only in
all those fifties people all those fifties cars all those fifties shops
where have they all gone
this picture has action all the way gene nelson and phyllis kirk do not sleep in twin beds things are brutal and quick but there is no excess of violence
the film is primarily a psychological tension drama as all true noir must be
noir is about doubt insecurity pressure and threats all around you with betrayal and trust as the key issues
oh yes and there s love too which generally takes place between the bullets rather than between the sheets
no one in a noir film has time to go to bed without being interrupted by a threatening phone call or someone banging on the door
you grab a kiss as you make a run for it
ok the actress is nice looking don t get me wrong but she so did not strike me as cathy striking beautiful like she should have been they killed the movie especially cathy they butchered her character and being my favorite book i was extremely critical and how can you mess up cookies and donuts it s not a huge thing why cookies
well i hate this movie it sucks and should be done with justice to the book
and no wonder they didn t do the whole series they killed off corrine which is something nobody can do without getting endless venting i think all of the loyal vca fans were outraged at this atrocious excuse for a book based movie
but hey i heard the original script was turned down you can see the guy s name still on the inside it was r rated which sadly means it was probably correct and they could have inserted a little of chris and cathy s relationship right
i love them together and it sucks they didn t include that
a group of american teens take a trip to trip on shrooms that is
told by a mutual friend about the ultimate drug trip by a certain type of magic mushroom they head to the woods to experience it for themselves
however after a bad batch the group begins to see unearthly visions of demonic apparitions trying to attack them
reality is blurred as the group of friends try to figure out if the visions are simple hallucination


or a true evil threat first of all may i ask where the hell did they get this irish guy
because


he s not irish and whatever casting director thought his british accent would go over as irish is absolutely ridiculous
just had to get that out
now onto the film i think i ve decided on a new title clichrooms
it s a nice blend on the two main components of this film shrooms and clich s
within the first ten minutes we re given the typical idiot stoner the nice girl in love with the bad boy with a heart of gold foreigner the travel deep in the woods for less than moral activity being stranded due to hitting an animal the shady forests looking for dinner etc
i won t even mention the dozen we get at the end of the film
it got annoying but eventually evened out when the plot developed
the acting isn t awful but not very good


just enough to make the film watchable
the backstory of the home for delinquents or whatever the wannabe irish guy was talking about was interesting and i m glad it was utilized a bit
the writing was quite off however resulting in stiff and boring dialogue and poor structure and eventually a bit of a cheap ending
breathnach s direction and nanu segal s cinematography weren t bad and worked well for the film although the trip visuals got a little too mtv in their editing
gore is almost nonexistent or cut away too quickly
dario marianelli an amazing composer is one positive on this film
the music is very good and it surprised me when i first heard it and surprised me even more when i saw the composer
the blur of reality and fiction is actually effective as it did make the film more than just a typical in the woods slasher
but it wasn t enough to make it as thrilling as it could ve been
it s entertaining enough just chock full of clich s which limit the worth of watching it final verdict
meh
this was sad
the plot apparently interesting characters made me hope for a kelly s heroes redux but instead ended up with something of a bad news bores
all the accents were horrible be they german canadian or some british varieties
the plot assembled a complex finale that was not only impossible to follow but it looks like it was impossible to shoot as well
neither was it clear what everyone s motivations were so you had to just put your faith in the director screenwriter but without any reward interesting characters the mysterious british paratrooper the canadian pilot he had potential the dutch partisans and the pair of german ne er do wells
but as in some greek tragedy they re left to flounder by the gods operation market garden did exist
it was smart to put that event as a backdrop but difficult for the producers to convincingly place operation matchbox in this context apart from the special effects involved in the gliders i hope people know that this actually happened
as a result the collection of oddball soldiers and this plot needed to work harder than they did to make this film shine
sadly nothing came through what i liked is that many characters were not black white something that reflects true wartime conditions when the very best worst in men women comes out
regardless this was supposed to be an entertaining film not what it ended up being some would question why i would see or review such a film
i do believe in diamonds in the rough and look for charm lucidity and originality but not at the expense of wasting my time
a true classic of s cinema and some that is the best way that i can begin to describe this one of my all time favorite movies once again i first saw this movie on my mum and dad s old phillips v when it was first released onto the u k s home cinema market hired from a seedy old video rental shop on the woolworth road and boy did it leave it s mark in short i love this movie o k
at times the story does tend to plod along at an almost snail s pace
but this is really a small price to pay for the film s wonderfully inspired set pieces
which when they come seem to hit you with the force of a speeding freight train
in fact just writing this review makes the hairs on the back of my neck tingle
as i remember each and everyone of them
with such crystal clear clarity that you would think i had only just finished watching the film for the umpteenth time
truth is it has now been about a year since i last saw it boy doesn t time fly when you re having fun if you ve seen this film before no doubt you ll have your own views on it and so don t need me to tell you how good bad it is however if you haven t trust me when i say that this film is a classic of the highest magnitude and that it would be an absolute crime for you not to see it
since the days gradually came on the royal family in great britain that they are to reign rather than rule the struggle has always been to be popular and stay popular without being self indulgent
they are the unifying symbol for their country rather than a written constitution that we yanks have so they re behavior good or bad counts for so much more the folks who established that tradition were victoria albert first cousins in the saxe coburg family and husband and wife
through her father the duke of kent young victoria was the heir to the british monarchy to which she ascended in royalty made its last gasp for power immediately preceding the events that are shown in this mini series
king william iv played here by peter ustinov by royal prerogative dismissed the government of prime minster earl grey
robert peel formed a tory government but it only lasted for a few months because parliament by now had firm control of the treasury
william iv was forced to call back earl grey and bow to the wishes of the people s representatives now even more representative since the reform act of reapportioned parliament after several hundred years so the monarchy was to reign instead of rule but if this bunch didn t keep a lid on the peccadilloes the folks in the united kingdom might just take it in their heads to be rid of them and get themselves a republic like their former colonies had done
that was the duty that prince albert jonathan firth saw it and he persuaded his young bride queen victoria victoria hamilton that they must do the same albert was a serious young man and victoria had been leading a sheltered life courtesy of her mother penelope wilton had led a life away from the dissolute hanoverian court of uncles george iv and william iv
when you have no other purpose in life but to set an example you d better be good at that
a few in the royal family haven t lived up to that down to this day
if you can t be good at least be discreet victoria albert is a good mini series from the bbc capturing the ambiance of the early victorian era very well indeed
diana rigg won an emmy for her performance as baroness lehzen young victoria s governess who didn t quite know when to let go you can enjoy it even if you re not familiar with british history
this was a great movie
i love movies of the week and watch them all of the time
i liked the idea of the family needing to feel safe so they move to the gated community
we all wonder what it would be like to live in that type of neighborhood
and don t we all dread that one neighbor who just has to be everyone s friend
lol
i really enjoyed alexandra paul too
she always delivers a good performance
she had great chemistry with the leading man as well
i thought the female villain was so well done
she was creepy and hilarious all at once
the actress was perfectly cast
if you are a big movie watcher like i am you have got to see this one
it seemed to have it all
it was suspenseful fun and the acting was also good
i wish we could see more movies like this one
one of the great animated films of all time grave of fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time japan
what happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten the children like its companion piece barefoot gen which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right this film proves that war is hell for everyone especially the children its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film the previously mentioned barefoot gen spawned sequels this has not but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war
it helps that however depressing this is its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story out of
this is by far the worst piece of poop i have ever seen in my entire life
none of the people who ever produced acted or directed this movie will ever hold a meaningful position in anything ever produced ever
not once did i laugh at anything in this movie except obnoxiously to annoy people
don t watch this movie ever
please i am saying this as a concerned human being
oh yeah and this is whats wrong with american film
at least it had something redeemable like the fact that all the asian s were masters of the martial arts or all the great well written hit in ball jokes or even the special effects see explosion at end of movie
save yourself brain cells and don t see this
in what is sure to be one of the most intriguing yet bizarre pictures to come about since the work of fellini luis bunuel directs this dramedy picture about the random incidents and moments that come about in the thought of the mind yet somehow reflect on the hypocrisies of society and man
told in a surreal mindset with objects and even animals that somehow come into scene it is one of those pictures that has many meanings in one
for example bunuel directs a sequence in which a young girl whom her parents are searching for and has been thought to have been kidnapped is actually right in front of the parents
it makes absolutely no sense but that is what is so striking about this scene as well as many in that the girl who is right in front of their eyes speaking with them can t be found thus sending these parents to act on their toes to try and find her
the film regards itself on random episodes that somehow have no connection with each other what so ever
from one scene to the next the stories are never quite fully developed until the end kind of like a soap opera
it is one of those types of pictures in which many different characters with their own dilemmas are left till the next time around to pick up where they left off in their sequence
the main quest for bunuel is to question the morality of the characters
why is it that society considers the idea of going to the restroom as something that has to be done in private
who created these rules
who created the rules that man has to be clothed in public but can do whatever he pleases in private
is this a moral question as to what is moral or not moral to do or is this something that society has created as something moral
bunuel leaves that up to his viewer to identity and question
shot in a similar fashion as many of the monty python pictures bunuel s film is definitely more subtle yet adventurous and hilarious at all means
it shows how surrealism doesn t always have to be dramatic and he strays away from his start in drama but achieves a perfect wisdom and understanding through it
it started off like an action movie for a minute then it goes back into time to the lead characters youths the beginning has got brandon hammond from soul food the movie and percy daggs iii from veronica mars and other unknowns which are all pretty good and yes i do enjoy the first minutes where the characters are in their teens even though it seems a little far fetched how short time it takes for the boys to start killing the competition i am not spoiling anything this is minutes into the movie or something anyways after minutes the guys are around years old or something and wearing suits and all that business like styled persona and it just turns into this snooze fest where there s hardly anything happening except for a big number of dialogs exchanged about the game and the crews various ideas of how to play it and the threat of investigating police you are suppose to believe that all friends are bosses of one gang each but there are no gang members shown in the movie which makes it even less convincing also the acting from the old cast is so much worse than the young cast i especially didn t like allen payne s character perhaps it was because he looked like he needed to do number on the bathroom half or all the time through out the movie i thought william l johnson playing old e bone was the only reason to keep watching well that and i did pay money for the dvd so i had to continue for it to end at least the first minutes was reminiscent of boyz n the hood which of course is a good movie but the rest minutes was reminiscent of sugar hill wesley snipes almost a copy of that movie actually but with a lot more twists and stuff if you happened to like sugar hill then you might like it but i don t like neither if you want a hood movie there are plenty of better ones such as snipes hustle flow clockers get rich or die trying baby boy the list could be long but i will stop there out of
the curious case of benjamin button is a film unlike any i ve ever seen and probably ever will
a true epic that left me utterly speechless
it accomplished so much through such simplicity
everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score
the film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness but for the incredible life we discover
it prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances just not in the same way
this is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance
this visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early th century who ages backwards
his tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love daisy
throughout life he goes through the same things we do growing up and eventually growing old
he s a thoughtful observer discovering life from all different angles
but it is not his life that makes him unique
his love is what makes him special
he spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her
as their lives tell us the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness
the direction in the film is almost flawless
hopefully benjamin button will garner david fincher the recognition he deserves
he winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish
at nearly hours there is not a minute wasted
every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time it is used wisely
the acting is also a thing of wonder
this is by far brad pitt s best performance
he is so believable and realistic throughout
his nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make up and cgi used to portray his character it is pitt who makes benjamin that much more curious
i left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly
it is an extremely graceful depiction of life love and the things we lose
after so much anticipation i was certainly not disappointed
this movie is probably not for everyone though
it s not your average drama that spoon feeds it s audience their emotions
it is something of awe and astonishment an absolute gem
what makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go
life in itself is indeed very very curious and benjamin button is no less of a wonder
the language and obscene gestures used through out the movie do not make this one suitable for children under the age of it starts when the main character meets bingo with delightful screams of holy sh and screaming matches calling each other chicken sh as well as the parents bickering like year olds and giving each other the finger when they turn their backs some of the humor is suitable for young adults and adults but small children should not see this one as an adult i found the language offensive and it did not add to the movie s value one bit
i think i remember the original reviews of this movie and they were universally bad
but sometimes one might enjoy a bad movie when it is seen as a historical context but this is not such a movie
it is unfaithful to the wonderful writing of raymond chandler
as an adaptation to the silver screen it does not even come close to the big sleep double indemnity or any other of raymond chandler s stories
montgomery s attempt at tough guy speech is ludicrous it s as though he is trying to emulate humphrey bogart while at the same time avoiding a comparison
furthermore it is derivative of hitchcock and orson wells but falls ridiculously short of these standards to be thought of as something revolutionary in film
probably the only value of this movie is to see jayne meadows at a very young age
she comes across as the perfect ingenue but is too sweet to have been a primary villain
i saw this on t v
and was fascinated by it
i m not a fan of hip hop because i think it is a degenerate art form created by an oppressed people
however this offshoot rize i think is culturally deep and relevant
it s a dance expression along with the tribal markings from black folks african ancestral memory
it s a dance that is similar to the continental african ethnic expression of their connection to nature but rize is more angry and rightly so
rize is the black americans expression of its connection to the ills of white supremacy and their disconnection from nature
the dance is their angry reaction to it both this is a great example of the ancestral spirit of black americans and why an african centered view will serve us well in the united states
this movie is hilarious
i have seen it several times and laugh just as hard every time i see it
no need for additional commentary here as the other commentary explains the movie
all i can say is make sure you see it
i actually suffered through minutes of this thinking that it might get better
please do yourself a favor and don t bother watching this unless you enjoy intolerably bad movies your time is better spent anywhere else
and i do mean anywhere it is hard to believe that any of these actors who participated in this movie did not get banned from the business permanently
it certainly is a black mark on their careers in my opinion so what was wrong with this movie
poor acting
bad jokes
bad plot what is good about this movie
you don t have to watch it
it was a pleasure watching this charming and heartwarming film
i went to see it without really knowing anything about it and found myself falling in love with the movie from the very beginning
it has such a simple yet emotionally satisfying premise a young boy searching for a hero to save his dying mother
the young actor made all the difference
besides his personal charisma and cuteness he also happens to be a real natural effortlessly performing in from of a camera
this goes for the rest of the cast too
it s just amazing how such a small film with unknown cast and crew can create such a beautiful movie a gem of a film
kurt russell plays a miami reporter who starts getting calls from a serial killer
the killer wants stories written about him so he gives russell inside information about the murders but soon it s russell who s the celebrity
unfortunately this interesting theme is wasted and the movie soon settles into mediocrity
the script has all the usual predictable plot devices that are supposed to lead us to the big surprise ending
russell is very good here as is richard jordan who plays the killer and in the end these performances are the only reason to stay with it
i first saw this film back in and only remembered that it was fiercely arousing to a young man at the time
i didn t catch the story however
times have changed since then and i recently viewed the film a couple of times when i wrote subtitles to it so i could show it to a close friend emmanuelle falls between x rated and art house
if one views it as an adult film then the lack of male frontal nudity and full on intercourse make the film feel timid
otoh for an art film the plot is quite thin when the film premiered in the mid s it made a stir
most of the brouhaha was about it being shown in regular theaters instead of seedy back alley ones
today we see so much erotics and sex in regular films and on tv that such discussions would seem ridiculous emmanuelle is based on the autobiographical novel with the same name by emmanuelle arsan
the book was banned in france ostensibly for too much erotic content but the foreign department may have influenced this since the story gives a decadent impression of them young and innocent emmanuelle travels to bangkok to her newly wed husband ten years her senior
he lives in a setting where bored embassy wives resort to promiscuity and intrigue to fend off a sense of boredom and lack of purpose in life
her husband clearly feels at home in this setting both her husband and the wives tell emmanuelle to get free of inhibitions which they themselves clearly have done
the film is essentially her journey towards that goal
her husband has others help him in her education at first viewing the film is admittedly just an erotic flick with thin connections between the erotic scenes
but after a few more times it becomes clear that director jaeckin and screen writer richard really tried to follow the book and the characters and their actions seemed plausible and natural perhaps the most surprising thing about this film is it does not seem old like many other european erotic films of the time one can also view this film as a discourse between the male and female aspects of sensuality
there is the male dream of sex and eroticism without emotional commitment and promiscuous relations with beautiful willing girls and women
and the possibly today somewhat outdated
female sexuality as sensuality commitment and pure love with its slow love making and longing for true companionship emmanuelle can also be seen as a spiritual road movie where she starts off as an innocent yet strongly sensual girl who slowly reaches sexual awareness and competence
from sex drive as the master to her as the master and erotics as just another tool in her chest i would strongly recommend this film especially for grown ups who have seen enough porn or love scenes in regular films and who want to remember instead what erotic meant
there still aren t that many films in this niche between porn and mainstream
cutting class is easily one of the most awful slasher flicks from the late s brian returns back to college aged after spending five years in a mental asylum for killing his father he tries to worm his way back into the lives of his ex best friend dwight and paula his old flame and suddenly a bunch of people start dying in the most bizarre and stupid ways in slasher film history there is for example death by pottery kiln death by photocopier but my favourite is the old classic flagpole under a trampoline so the fascist gym teacher gets impaled on the american flag cutting class is a stinking piece of crap filled with silly jokes and a little bit of gore the acting is downright horrible and the characters are completely flat there is no suspense and the killings are lame this film is clearly as bad as hollow gate or return to horror high avoid it like a plague out of
a successful financial executive eddie murphy has more time for his blackberry than his seven year old daughter yara shahidi
when he has a crisis of confidence and his career starts going down the drain however he finds the solution to all his problems in his daughter s imaginary world
where to begin i know
why this movie was bad
well for starters eddie murphy hasn t taken any good roles since beverly hills cop and thomas haden church is more smarter than to accept a role like that
now i know it s a kids movie but even the kid sitting next to me said it was a con
my advice either wait until the dvd or just don t bother
imagine that
scary movie adds a new element to the usual movie formula reality
a few scenes from the dubya administration s history are reproduced and an embarrassing moment from mr cruise s midlife crisis are re lived in addition to the usual spoofs of various horror and sci fi films
the dubya scenes nicely done by leslie nielson were the highlights of the film for me
i m not a fan of brainless comedy but this non formula material made the film tolerable for me
sm spends a lot of time with the village saw and war of the worlds plus a couple of films i only vaguely recognized blending the plots cleverly but without adding much to the comedic value in the blending technique
brokeback mountain is also parodied though i do not understand why this was considered a scary movie
the film is funny at times but brow beats its parody of tom cruise s character in war of the worlds
nevertheless it s a fun little romp and much less grotesque than some of the previous entries in the series
acting good for what it is
directing good for what it is
script ok but could have been more intellectually challenging and funnier cinematography good for what it is
recommended for fans of the series but don t expect it to be the funniest
the only thing that stops me giving this film one star is the cast
it s rare to find this many good character actors in one movie i didn t realise as i watched but apparently too late the hero is meant to be an allegory for america s war against vietnam
trying to draw parallels between vietnam and wwii really doesn t work despite a vehement anti war streak the movie seems to delight in its action sequences almost daring us to cheer as the nominal bad guys get shot or blown up it s this inconsistency in tone that destroys too late the hero
what point is the film trying to make
is denholm elliot s character a cowardly villain or a shot away crazy brave hero
why does cliff robertson s character refuse to accept a simple change of plan at a crucial moment
is he a coward or a by the book officer
why does michael caine s character alternate between anti authority and gung ho heroics
what quite simply is ronald fraser s character s problem
if he s that much of a coward surely he d have found a more effective way of invaliding himself by now
what makes lance percival s character follow a murderous and cowardly comrade into a japanese trap
there are too many questions going unanswered even before the film s chance of survival finale
if you re looking for a more realistic portrayal of british soldiers fighting in south east asia during wwii watch the b w film the long and the short and the tall
if you re looking for a more realistic portrayal of american troops in vietnam the choice is endless
too late the hero was recently given away as a free dvd with a uk newspaper which gives a good indication of how lame it is
this documentary takes a very honest and unflinching look at modern day racism is suburban america particularly how people like bill riccio take advantage of kids who have nowhere else to turn
the film looks at the inner workings of riccio s home and group of neo nazis from recruitment of new members to meetings of the kkk
in this setting bill riccio and his followers recruit teens who come from bad home situations or have become homeless they need a place to stay and someone to take care of them but unfortunately they end up with a racist extremist
like a non fiction american history x the directors were able to document the transition of several normal teens into followers of the aryan youth nation
the documentary filmmakers were allowed to view and tape events such as teens celebrating the birthday of hitler and anti minority marches taking place in minority neighborhoods
it can be difficult to endure since many things in the film fall into the category of something i would never do yet watching it is like seeing a train wreck chilling and disturbing but you just can t turn away from it
this is an informative and truly disturbing experience
okay first off it wasn t an absolutely horrible film
the soundtrack was kinda neat although very oddly placed along side the story
i fully agree with many of the other posters here which i should have bloody well taken more time to read first
when they say that the visuals and the vague fundamental mood of the film is good
but it is so dang blah they simply could have done waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more with it
the way the dialog was written and staged directed left a hell of a lot to be desired
needless to say forest whitaker s accent was absolutely categorically and completely annoying and unnecessary
i mean did anyone else bloody well sound like that
what the hell was the point
geez if the director had just done everything the same except added some really good stylistic lynchian surreal touches bloody something
then maybe i could have at least lived with it very very disappointing
and featuring the likeable clown from freaks
what more could one ask
a low budget old dark house mystery that is better than it needs to be with sharp dialogue and engaging characters can t go wrong why can t all b pictures be this good
marty is typical guy who wants to spice up his boring married sex life
he gets the idea that he should get his wife together with another woman and he does this because he is self centered of course
at first his wife does not want to be with another woman but soon enough she likes it
she likes being with another woman so much that she starts to reject marty and his whole plan blows up in his face i think marty gets what he deserves and it s pretty funny
he gets more than he asks for and that is what makes the movie great
the whole scene with the sister is pretty funny as well
wishes do come true and sometimes they come true a little too much
in the sequel to the cult horror hit ginger snaps brigitte emily perkins finds herself transforming into the same monster that killed her sister
she has been injecting herself with too much monkshood she o d s is mistaken for a junkie and wins herself a trip to the happier times rehab center
there brigitte meets a young girl named ghost tatiana maslany who is a very strange and curious kid and might help brigitte with the cure
the two of them become very close almost like sisters even but now brigitte has a bigger problem another werewolf has been stalking her and now he wants to mate
i am probably the biggest fan of ginger snaps and i was highly anticipating the sequel
as soon as i saw the opening credits i knew that i was in for a treat
emily perkins was simply amazing the gore was beautiful and the dark humor and atmosphere were similar to the first one
the makeup was better where as the first ginger snaps was more emotional
of course it wasn t as good as the first one but what sequel ever really is
like i said the acting and makeup was awesome and the soundtrack was great too
i also really enjoyed the short but sweet appearances by my beloved katharine isabelle as ginger
the ending was very disappointing though it kind of ruined the whole movie for me
but if i forget the last minutes this movie was excellent and almost gave me as much pleasure as the first one
i would give ginger snaps ii unleashed
few actresses jump from a thespic nowhere into a star role
you might count them on the fingers of one hand
but it happened to nancy guild
signed to a fox contract when casting director rufus le maire spotted her picture in a life magazine lay out of current college girl dress fashions nancy jumped straight from fox s dramatic school where she spent a few months as the star pupil to the lead feminine role in joseph l mankiewicz s somewhere in the night
and she does well too
extremely well by a rather difficult role
is she a good girl or one of the villains
nancy plays it cool which is a perfect choice especially when surrounded by consummate scene stealers like richard conte lloyd nolan john hodiak and fritz kortner
but her debut proved to be the high point of her motion picture career
next cast in a fox b the brasher doubloon opposite george montgomery s philip marlowe she followed with a minor dan dailey musical give my regards to broadway
fox then dropped her
at this stage orson welles came to her rescue by offering her the part of marie antoinette in black magic in which gregory ratoff fronted for him as producer and director
ratoff actually did direct half the movie but welles handled all his own scenes and wrote some of his own dialogue
although this united artists release was anything but a success universal offered miss guild a contract
she played the main feminine role in abbott and costello meet the invisible man and was then third billed mark stevens and rhonda fleming were the stars featured on all the posters in little egypt
fourth billing in francis covers the big town and a minor role in otto preminger s such good friends completed her motion picture career
eight film roles only one of which her first is of any importance
what a waste
getting back to the rivetingly noir somewhere in the night this movie is not just an actor s heyday which it is you ll probably miss the clever way one of the players signals the plot to the audience in the first minutes so watch for it on a second view but a photographer s and set designer s paradise as well
mankiewicz keeps a firm control of both acting and atmosphere
this exceedingly well produced movie always enjoyed a considerable cult reputation which for once was thoroughly deserved
full marks for a really solid script on which none other than leading novelist w somerset maugham worked with lee strasberg later to gain fame with his actors studio
body and soul released by united artists in was apparently made after actor john garfield got out of his warner brothers contract
he had made many films with them but wanted to be more independent
in this film garfield plays charley davis a lower middle class new yorker with a talent for boxing
not unlike many boxers certainly of that time period using your fists for sport was a way out of your meager background
while i have never been a big fan of john garfield and did not consider him a top notch actor of the golden age of hollywood this part does seem made for him
garfield is quite good here playing the conflicted charley with skill and credibility
there are actually few real boxing scenes in the film except for the end and that is why labeling this as a boxing movie seems a bit deceptive
there are capable supporting players including the lovely lili palmer who loves charley
robert conrad and lloyd gough ably play the tough guy thugs who want charley to sell his soul for money
a notable performance by african american actor canada lee is striking considering this is and is treated as an equal by the white actors
garfield was known for his politically liberal views and perhaps this is why he later ended up as an enemy of the communist witch hunters in washington
garfield s untimely death at age was a shock to many his funeral was mobbed by thousands
perhaps this elevated his image above the work he left behind in film but still this film and a handful of others are quite good
this film tackles a very serious subject of the sudden and violent post war dec death of general george patton the film builds up to the denouement of showing this death to be an assassination something i have thought was a distinct probability given the enemies he made during and post the allied victory over germany
the story line of the motivations behind the assassination is built up around the theft a huge quantity of the gold that the national socialist government had accumulated that went missing in action so to speak
the film shows a train hi jack of the gold though not sure if that happened but huge quantities of gold did disappear post war germany and was never found whether this was really the route and the root of the motivations behind the events which led to his sudden death is debatable but i am very intrigued as to whether or not the death of patton as shown here was a reasonable accurate re creation of that death something which sadly appears not to worry too many of the previous reviewers
the build up to the set up so that his vehicle came round a bend and hit a parked lorry seemed to be well done and just how you would expect an accident to be pre arranged kennedy s portrayal of patton s aggressive anti soviet anti communism with the post war red army command s behaviour having no difficulty coming right down to meet the low expectations patton had of them seemed well done
patton had many enemies in the us
one of the things that he did to infuriate those who wanted to use the allied victory to unleash a vindictive payback over and against the defeated enemy was to release the post war pow s under his jurisdiction the only set of post war pow s to be set free during that time to go back home instead of suffering and dying of starvation and disease in unsheltered open fields surrounded by barbed wire and shot at by guards as was the fate of others german solders in these post war death camps
these germans were to be made to pay time and again for their collective sin with a usurious rate of interest so that punishment and retribution was to be their fate
patton wasn t interested in such policies once the victory had been won but his internal enemies were
he was recalled to the us and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but patton s enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their pay back time in quickly before he did get back to the us and start to interfere with their plans against post war germany because of his high status in the us despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility so an uneven film methinks with some good parts and some bad but the slices of good parts giving food for thought about the great man s demise
now i m not going to say this film is terrible but its not good in the slightest
with it being rated on this site makes me laugh
the film is basically about a hair dressing competition in england a little dismal i know the only thing stopping me rating it so low is the cast even though they didn t do a good job its nice to see them all in one film
josh hartnett lucky number slevin sin city days of night pearl harbor and wicker park is a brilliant actor but has an odd accent in this
alan rickman dogma die hard and the harry potter films is also a fantastic actor but doesn t really pull off being an english hair dresser
rachael leigh cook antitrust josie and the pussycats bill nighy the boat that rocked underworld shaun of the dead warren clarke clockwork orange i d
and rachel griffiths six feet under are also in the film
so if there was any film with a cast like that you would definitely give it a second look
just too bad the film was poorly made and quite tiring to watch i would like to say that i d recommend this to girls as it is sort of a chick flick but i wouldn t wanna give them false hopes on seeing a good film j d seaton
this is one of the best movies that i have seen
they did a great job of putting the stories of shining time station and thomas the tank engine together
mara wilson alec baldwin didi conn britt allcroft and everybody else did a great job
i liked how they gave all the engines different voices they had about of them instead of one doing the voices for everybody
they should keep doing this for the episodes of the tv series
they could find somebody talented like june foray tom kenny and bob saget to do the voices
the only thing that i wanted to see more of was more of the engines but there are like of them so i guess that is impossible
i am surprised that it wasn t a success
britt allcroft quit and now they changed the show and even the show s name
i liked the movie and i think that they should make the episodes like it
they said that it didn t do well because they edited too much with out going back and adding more scenes to replace the ones that they edited
they said that because of this it made the movie confusing
but i never noticed any of this
i think it is a great movie and i also liked the part where gordon says he knows everything
i also like the parts where mr
conductor must escape from diesel and pinchy
a concert film of standup comedian richard pryor recorded live at the terrace theatre in long beach california there are some artists who are so original fearless and groundbreaking that they inspire and influence almost every other artist in their field who comes after them
this is how i think of richard pryor the comedian s comedian
this concert showcases him at the top of his game with an electrifying performance a nonstop riff on sex families racism drugs the police death pets boxing and the great outdoors
pryor pours everything he has into it whether it be recreating a heart attack onstage demonstrating the correct method for falling over when knocked out delivering the most perfectly timed gag about a hunting rifle or an amazing moment where he becomes a child lying about a breakage which i absolutely guarantee will have tears streaming down your cheeks
as with all great comedy the writing and artistry behind this is seamless and invisible almost as if pryor just strolled on and made it all up
it s impossible to see how he moves from one topic to the next or to watch him perform for even a minute without being swept up in his rap
the man was simply a genius
the film itself epitomises his daring nobody had ever released a major theatrical feature of a standup comedy performance before and no movie studio wanted it
instead it was released independently was a smash hit and went on to become one of the most successful comedy videotapes of all time
followed by two more concert films made by columbia live on the sunset strip in and here and now in
pryor had many problems in his life but there is no denying the natural talent with which he clawed himself up from nothing into a trailblazing comedy superstar who influenced everybody from eddie murphy to eddie izzard
witness that talent with this fantastic time capsule of his comic brilliance
this is really an oddball
i really wanted more from it but viewing this is kind of like having an almost flat soda and trying to tell yourself it s still good two different movies wanted to be made here a soap operaish character piece and a police melodrama
all we got was a melodrama of the very bad kind where to start
stanwyck s character acts in wildly improbable ways and is inconsistent
she starts in a newsroom doing the ann landers bit and it seems that she might want more and is certainly capable of it maybe a reporting job
care was put into creating the newsroom atmosphere including having a sandwich boy prattling on about sandwiches and it s ike from the waltons
and a lot of period detail
you think you re going to get some sort of newsroom police drama
uh but no the brakes are pretty much put on full just as you are getting acquainted with the atmosphere as the film continues it appears that stanwyck gets a better job in ny
she is going to move on up to something better suddenly the plot creakily shifts and we never see the newsroom or the sandwich boy for that matter hell thought he might show up as a witness or something later on i mean this was supposed to be a noir right
stanwyck who doesn t believe in marriage kids or anything like that suddenly marries a police office she barely knows and met during work it s not minutes of screen time between when she seemingly rejects anything but a career and is next going on and on about wanting to do nothing but darn hayden s socks
no i am not kidding then just as suddenly she is bored of living with hayden her cop husband and begins scheming to get him ahead in his career
if she is so bored why is she not working
i didn t get the impression he would mind
but instead she gets into all sorts of mischief from staged accidents to affairs to get him ahead in the middle of all these things she wants him to transfer to beverly hills where it would be quieter
how is that moving him forward
it s inconsistent with her wanting him to move ahead
when all else fails she murders someone as if that would propel them both forward
how could it when the results of the investigation would send her to the gas chamber
why was his promotion that important to her to lose her life or freedom over
just a few minutes earlier in the film promotion was not important it was a transfer to a dead end quiet job in beverly hills
huh
the whole thing doesn t add up or make any sense at all and one other thing just what is it with that huge looming drive in screen outside their home
i thought that was going to play in somehow maybe the noise coming over and bothering the characters maybe masking an important sound i don t know heck just in my wonderings here i am coming up with plot ideas that could have worked better
this cast and story foundation deserved so much more than this very strange movie
i have no idea whether this was an indie movie or even what the definition would be but it was pretty pathetic
the plot was horribly slow acting was horrible
i d call it a bad b movie but i think it was trying to be artsy
only the fact that i d forced my g f to rent it thinking it would be a great b kept me watching the whole thing
if a plot won t go anywhere at least make it intellectually stimulating like rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
truly one of the worst movies i ve seen
this was a bad dramatisation of a classic
although the cast had potential i couldn t help but feel that this dramatisation hammed up sherlock holmes horribly and failed to evoke the atmosphere and norms of edwardian england
it was yet another remake that failed to provide a new insight into the story
i particularly disliked the characterisation of the relationship between holmes and watson it seemed that holmes held watson permanently in contempt which is not something that i felt when reading the stories
even richard e grant was disappointing and seemed to be over acting i suspect that was due to poor direction
for me the best dramatisation of this story is the jeremy brett version which combines wonderful acting with a real sense of history and atmosphere
in fact for me the jeremy brett series is the most authentic and atmospheric dramatisation of the adventures of sherlock holmes to date
if you want ham look at the basil rathbone version which is wonderful in a different way and don t waste your time on this
yes the two leads are cute and they do some awkward almost chuckle producing frontal nudity but beware this stinker
nothing is as tasteless as a souffl that doesn t rise and this gay rom com has all the tasty buoyancy of a hockey puck
forget the cheap sets poor cinematography and weak soundtrack a gay indie with a bunch of newcomers is entitled to take short cuts
but the script
so much lame drivel masquerading as dialogue with an occasional hip quip about meat loaf or anne heche that stands out like a sixth finger on a hand it s so clumsy the actors no matter how cute are at sea with this poor a script
scott lunsford is a total cypher in the impossible role of a deeply passive straight guy who pretends to be gay so he can romance a screechy straight woman
she s emily hands and you haven t seen this raspy a performance since elizabeth berkley in showgirls
ryan carnes is way cute as a gay stud but has little presence
he and lunsford share the silliest most embarrassing nude scene in recent history
after some poorly shot and choreographed oral sex the director actually shoots them pulling up their pants so we can see their weenies
a new low of sorts
and yes that jim guy from american idol is the gay geek
his character is the closest to a real person but he s no actor this is the worst gay comedy i ve seen since all over the guy
if you flipped for the west hollywood drivel run out and rent this
otherwise stick with trick or passing glances real movies about real gay people i only go on so long because i am amazed at all the good reviews this film has received
does the director have hundreds of dear friends or have gay people lost their common sense and good taste
this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the moulin rouge dance hall
in many ways this reminds me of the hollywood musicals of the s and s in that it has many clich s leading up to the inevitable conclusion will the show still go on
while of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made
the musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch
in many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of the great ziegfeld
in real life ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the american film
but in french cancan the characters have fully functioning libidos but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kids nothing new but well done nevertheless
in fact i saw first the play in the s in my city barcelona in a very good performance and the public was very delightful
as a curiosity the role of the mother was played by a man
that gave a satirical and extravagant turn to the show
unfortunately the film of quine is sadly a disaster a comedy without grace very boring and it is a pity that such a talented director fall so low in this movie it is very difficult to complete the vision of this film
the impression of the play was that it is a experimental comedy
but the impression of the film is that it is a very nonsense history with characters very ridiculous
sous le sable tells the story of marie drillon excellently performed by charlotte rampling whose husband disappears when they are on holiday after he went for a swim in the sea
what follows is the struggle of marie who can t accept the fact that her husband is dead and that he will never return
in several scenes is shown that marie still talks to her husband in the present tense like he s only gone for a couple of days but will return very quickly
in one of the last scenes we know for sure her husband is dead because they found his body
in that scene we see again that she just can t accept it because the body that is found has all the characteristics of her missing husband but she still denies that it is her husband charlotte rampling gives a remarkable performance
the movie is partly based on something francois ozon experienced in real life
years ago when he was at the beach he saw a woman who s husband was went for a swim in the sea and didn t seem to return
he always wondered what happened to the woman and her missing husband
excellent movie francois ozon is a brilliant director
i ve seen femmes as well and this is also a very good movie although it s something completely different
this is truly a terrible movie
the dialog is beyond cheesy the special effects might have been cutting edge in the eighties
the acting
bad
i could go on and on
the thing that got me the most was the classic sci fi movie blunder the city
rather than try to actually pretend to destroy an existing city they just have a bunch of buildings and call it the city
the dialog reflects this such as the monster is attacking the city or if it gets to the city we are done for or the aliens are directly over the city
as if there was only one city on the planet
horrible fifties scare film starring mutant rodents gone bad apparently molemen and giant mantis weren t bad enough to scare folks
these shrews are nothing but greyhounds with poorly made costumes
the film is chalk full of racial stereotypes bad special effects and lacks any bit of sense
out of all the creatures to experiment on why shrews
our swedish scientist tries to make the creatures sound deadly by assuring us that they will eat three times their body wait
the fake shrews weren t the worst part of the movie in my opinion
there is subtle racism at every corner
our captain has an uncle tom african american counterpart and there is a helpful mexican stereotype named mario to assist our heroes
you know i never realized how influential duane jones performance in night of the living dead was until i saw this piece of trash
rent only if you want to turn off your brain for an hour or so
works better as a comedy than a scare film
the title sounds like a sleazy porn film but lust for a vampire is actually a flawed hammer classic
it is in styria and mircalla karnstein is biting men and women in a classy girl school
the well lit colour photography looks more natural than the jewel like gone with the wind colours of s jack asher period but it is still beautiful and the gothic sets and suitably melodramatic score are wonderful
so is miss mircalla who has truly striking sensuous presence and the breast baring and heavy breathing lipstick lesbianism is actually very tame
what comes to mircalla s walking in the sunlight well you poor illiterates dracula and carmilla and all the vampires before the silent nosferatu could happily do that thank you
the only problem in this enjoyable if silly film is some truly horrible acting from ralph bates and the gay caricature in the tavern
chuck jones s there they go go go the ninth road runner cartoon is the inevitable moment when this excellent series finally hits a snag
having managed to sustain genuine brilliance across the last four cartoons there they go go go feels like a very tired entry into the series
even the title seems to indicate a dearth of ideas
many people when they think of the road runner shorts imagine a repetitive and not especially funny set of predictable gags
if they wanted proof to back up this argument then there they go go go would be the ideal candidate
set against the more stylised backgrounds introduced in the previous cartoon gee whiz z z there they go go go fails to offer enough funny gags to distract attention away from the less sumptuous scenery and the impression i am left with is that of an unattractive and unamusing cartoon
there s a couple of chuckles but that can be said of practically any road runner cartoon bar the dire later ones
all in all there they go go go is a disappointment but is easily excused as an inevitable hiccup in a series that managed to sustain the same premise for an astonishing amount of time
this movie is a total joke in my opinion
from the lame story line to the absolute stealing of ideas from other movies such as harry potter lord of the rings the matrix and the goonies
that would not be so bad had it been executed well
i couldn t find anything good about this film at all if i am being honest
perhaps some of the special effects were okay but that is very easy to get done properly these days i think
i thought the story was bad the music was the bad and the acting was terrible
probably the first time i ever felt i wanted to leave the cinema during a film
i cannot understand why this movie made it to the cinema if i compare it to other ones which do not
this movie simply insults the intelligence of the viewer and that is made worse by the fact that it is more aimed to children
absolutely awful and a waste of time
melanie griffith is horribly miscast and would fool not one hacedic jew in crown heights with her undercover role
tracy pollan deserves a special golden turkey for the single worst supporting performance in a pivotal role in a drama
she single handedly ruins any credibility the film might have ever had
the oh now i m really beginning to appreciate the beauty of the hacedic culture scenes are forced and contrived especially the big family meal
john pankow delivers the movie s most interesting performance in a thankless role
lodge kerrigan made two very good movies before keane they were clean shaven and claire dolan
he specializes in depicting cinematically the troubled landscape of the human mind
his latest shares similarities with clean shaven in that it is also about a mentally ill man damian lewis searching for a missing daughter
lewis s portrayal of william keane almost comes close to eclipsing peter green s extraordinary portrayal of a schizophrenic in the former film almost but not quite kerrigan is interested in the intricacies of behavior and is able to render every moment between two people fascinating
his direction of keane s blossoming relationship with abigail breslin is superb as are the sequences in which keane searches for his missing daughter the film s final revelation is a scorcher this is not a pleasant or simplistic film
it is documenting a reality that feels familiar
it is not as graphic or physically confronting as clean shaven which is both great drama and great horror but it is riveting
i don t think you could accuse this one of being a particularly good film but it is fun for the genre
slasher films have experimented with supernatural villainy with varying success and in this cheery and cheesy item a ouija board unleashes an evil being who proceeds to kill in reasonably bloody ways
although this one is hard to take seriously with a muddled script nondescript performances and a general feeling of badness it is enjoyable
virgil makes for a pretty cool killer the ending is unexpected and the gore though cheap and occasionally of the squirt gun blood variety is fun to watch and ace in a couple of places
basically this is a good bad slasher that won t blow anyones mind but is worth a look for slasher movie hounds who are likely to be the only folk interested in this anyway
absorbing profile of robert crumb an underground cartoonist
shows him at work and interacting with his friends and heavily dysfunctional family
i had no idea who robert crumb was all i knew was that he created fritz the cat and i find underground comics repulsive but i was never bored or repelled by this movie
it has him talking about his life and his work along with interviews with his family and friends also discussing him and his work the film shows many of crumb s graphic work very graphic for an r rated movie and has him discussing analyzing and at times defending his work
we also see oppossing or agreement from other art critics or artists
what s most interesting is that we see he came from a very destructive family and puts all of his hatred and childhood misery into his drawings
i still don t like underground comics but this movie helped me understand them to a degree
also a haunting look at a disturbed family but it s treated sort of lightly not dark and heavy very interesting and well done
not for everyone but great for those with very open minds
i loved this film
it filled my heart with joy and was sexier than any porn film i ve seen
i was utterly convinced by everything in it and have watched it again and again
for me as a pro palestian activist of many years standing i did not care where they were or what they were doing there
this film was very masculine and very gay a combination that i find wonderful
the snoggin as we call it in the uk was really sexy and utterly convincing
the film was far too sort
i needed more between jossi and jaggar in particular more kissing because it was wonderful
the icing on the cake would be to learn that there were any lesbian or gay people involed
the actors were fine but it helps our cause
so young master jack ryan s mommy must say every time she packs him out the front door to go to school little knowing her cute poppet is in fact leading a double life as a cia analyst as well as learning the names of the capital cities of europe doubtless worried he might develop a crush on his teacher she would be horrified to learn he is dating a doctor nearly twice his age
never mind mrs r he s bound to get straight a s in saving the planet from a nuclear holocaust and here s how it all started are you sitting comfortably then i ll begin
once upon a time back during the second middle east conflict the israelis had a plane in the air carrying a nuclear bomb if they looked like losing how s that for bad sportsmanship they would bomb the crap out of egypt sort of like picking up their toys and stomping off home this plane or one of a number of planes so equipped i m a bit confused on this point is shot down and lies hidden in the desert for years until it is discovered by arabs and a south african taken over from the brits in the international villain stakes buys it for dollars selling it on to a unregenerate nazi for million said unregenerate nazi mr alan bates a chain smoker just to add to his general bastardness uses it to blow up a football stadium in baltimore thus plunging the world into the nuclear abyss go figure
luckily young master ryan is able to get a few days off school to persuade the russian premier and the president of the united states that he knows better than either of them and after some jolly tense moments the president grits stand down to defcon thus earning young jack a gold star
i have never read the book on which this daft movie was based i can only imagine that it has been dumbed down and made more child friendly
perhaps young jack can read it for himself when he gets a bit older
until then he should content himself with learning that paris is the capital of france vienna is the capital of austria are you paying attention i ll be asking questions later
this is one of those japanese samurai films where the red paint cost probably more than everything else in the movie
this movie inspired quentin tarantino to make kill bill so if you liked that movie you should watch this one
the plot is quite simple the japanese girl is seeking revenge for the killers of her parents but the killers are tougher than she thought and this is where the bloody fight between good and evil begins
the movie is well directed and the acting is pretty good
there is a lot of violent swords fights but it looks kind of funny sometimes
if you are samurai film fan you really should watch this one it s one of the best in it s gender
who knows out of what strange game of fate or as if the universe conspired upon its creation and everything that came to pass did so that tobe hooper would make the texas chainsaw massacre
like a blood spattered low budget orson welles of s exploitation the immensity of his debut will forever haunt him and his career the task of committing tcm to words is a difficult one not because the proper words don t exist but merely because they can only describe the surface and never convey the essence and the heart and what can only be felt in one s own skin and maybe that of others
sounds of animals and howling of beasts and the clanking of rustling metal speak tcm s language
the dissonant chord that sounds in the soundtrack as the movie fades from black to flashes of decaying flesh is tcm s lingo and what defines it is disorientation indeed the first shot proper that opens the movie that of a rotten head and as the camera zooms out we see the whole dead body in a grotuesque posture like some sort of zombified jester sitting atop a gravestone offers no clue and safe grip for the viewer
after the opening credits roll we are served an orange sun burning in a blackened sky and that dissolves into the image of a dead armadillo laying on the street
we re minutes into the movie and we re provided no clues of typical genre orientation no protagonists of any sort
as the eye scans the image for something to cling to narrative or otherwise there s nothing there save for decay and death and then tcm starts rolling and picks up steam and never stops
apart from how original or not the concept is crazed backwoods family terrorizing city kids it s the approach that makes all the difference
hooper achieves sensory terror and doom by piling on images and sounds each of them spilling to the next frame starting an avalanche of horror
a close shot of cattles as the van drives in the background a seedy gas station a crazed hitch hiker the kids pick up an abandoned house
in the interior shots of the abandoned house the blacks are crushed and we only see silhouettes moving against the textures in the walls and those are juxtaposed with exterior shots where the whites wash out like some kind of rural hell a land of some other order that is coming apart under the weight of its own abandonment even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out yeah see you in an hour or so followed by a drone in the score and we just know he s never gonna see them again a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers that only lasts for seconds
then hooper cuts back to puzzling images feathers on the ground and some kind of dreamcatcher made of bone
and weird buzzing sounds in the score like otherwordly insects flying unseen
tcm constantly tips its own axis content to be left out of balance the first encounter with notorious chainsaw wielding leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it
he appears out of nowhere like a beast in a frenzy and the carnage begins
and for a movie of tcm s reputation there is surprisingly no or at least little explicit gore
yet the violence is startling and raw as the images that preceed its outburst spill into it and add their own touch of the morbid
eisenstein must have been clairvoyant when he spoke of how powerful montage can be we re also given glimpses to leatherface s tortured crazed soul bits of characterization like a gesture and a look of his eyes
not a psycho killer out of sadistic pleasure perhaps he looks more like a savage beast defending its territory or a wild dog scared of intruders trespassing in his nest like an avalanche of macabre images that is impossible to stop once it starts tcm whizzes by in a manic pace
the chase scene where leatherface hunts down marilyn burns scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal is shot through branches of trees as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death
even when hooper overplays his hand as in the dinner scene it s all done with deliberation that cannot be ignored like maybe the director is as insane as the characters he s depicting and he takes great pleasure in basking in their insanity tcm simply has to be experienced no critical analysis can do it justice
without bucketloads of gore without the slick look of high budget it remains one of the most bleak atmospheric and aurally violent movies of all time
what happened to tobe hooper s career after it is anyone s guess but tcm is good enough to top entire filmographies of other directors
it has been imitated countless times remade and given sequels and prequels to but there s something primeval about the original that can t be recaptured
another year another swedish public service christmas spectacle
every year around christmas svt has a new big production to show and every year it feels at least a little bit disappointing
and as far as these go snapphanar has to be one of the worst in recent years what shocks me most about this production is undoubtedly the incredibly low level of ambition
it s always easier for me to forgive a movie when it aims for the stars and fail
snapphanar barely aims for the tree line it seems and still it disappoints
maybe it s a sign of extremely low self esteem in swedish public service the strange thing is that on the surface this production is not that bad
the visuals are pretty good the production values are not bad for a in international perspective low budget production
but under the cracks in the surface you can see how shallow it is
here we see the low ambition that i mentioned earlier
historical facts are fabricated changed or just simply ignored
and the script seems to be written by a ten year old
the plot is simplistic the twists can be seen a mile away and the story itself is uninteresting and bland
as a theme the story about snapphanar could be interesting
it s as far as i know a rather unique thing in swedish history
a partisan group wanting to make the shire sk ne part of denmark instead of sweden fighting armed battle for their cause
but the whole premise is squandered here by poor writing and non existent regard for historical facts
also the fact that these partisan rebels seem to be a gang completely inane idiots doesn t help
they are portrayed like a bunch of stumbling do gooders completely without fighting skill making it very clear why sk ne is still swedish today well how about entertainment value
sometimes a decent entertainment value on the surface can save even the most shallow movie
not in this case though i m afraid
there are just too many things to be annoyed about even if you don t think to closely about what you re watching
the incomprehensible accents sounding like the sk ne dialect mixed with danish and a tinge of retardation the le pacte des loups inspired fighting scenes that lack energy and the names and dialog that makes you laugh at the most inappropriate moments
directors m rlind and stein have a distinctive hollywood complex that also shines through in a disturbing way i don t know how much snapphanar cost to produce
it looks more expensive than most standard swedish tv fare but since it was made in estonia it was probably quite cheap
no matter though since this was definitely a case of very little bang for your buck
i just wonder when swedish tv and film makers will understand that a good and solid script is the base in every good movie
when they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script instead of burning their money on fight scenes filmed from three angles then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time
don t see this movie
i stopped watching after minutes or so
this is terrible acting there is no story and i couldn t figure out what was happening and why anyway
just don t do it
this is certainly an interesting study of a psychopathic killer and of the man who sets out to track him down after his fiance disappears mysteriously at a gasoline stop in france
it is known in the english speaking world as the vanishing and was remade in with an american cast
without revealing the startling denouement one cannot explain the most attractive aspects of the film which is the detailed study of both tracker and killer that occupies most of the last half
the unsatisfying part is that while we see many details of these two men s lives we are given little insight into their motivations
we have to piece it out for ourselves
that s probably what the director wanted
madness and curiosity are obvious motivations but not really enough
with these cavils i will still say that spoorloos is at once terrifying gripping and well amazing
it is well acted but poorly photographed and edited
one suspects the director is of the sort who doesn t regard these things as important
i saw this movie when i was a child and i love it
it was one of my favorites movies
now after years i am very disappointed
i saw all the flaws all the mistakes
the acting is really bad especially in the first episodes
the movies tries to rely on the book but its much more compress and much more less enjoyable
the ending witch is different from the book is not bad is absolutely awful
one of the worst endings i ve seen no substance no logic the ending in the book is much good
if you seen this movie in your childhood i recommend not to see it again
if you didn t see it i recommend you to avoid seeing
the book is really good i recommend you read it instead of watching this
i suppose i m somewhat biased but as someone who worked on the show during it s first season i found it to be an absolutely abysmal experience the dop while being a pompous ass managed to turn out something that looked grainy and amateurish
if his talent could only have equaled his impression of himself it might have looked like something decent chris playing himself whatever and producer had little tolerance for your normal technical requests other than find your light the rest of the cast were quite pleasant to work with could have been a good show if the producers had listened to concerns expressed or had found something funny to shoot i always refer to it as a comedy
like an updated version of the monkees but shot for cable with cursing and without the flying around high speed on wires and without being funny you only have so much lamp life on your tv
save it for something good
feast is one of those horror movies that redefine a certain genre in this case feast redefines the man eating monster genre the monsters in this film snatch up their victims one by one in grizzly and gory fashions even a young boy meets his own brutal fate the monsters move so fast when they kill someone that you can hardly see them maybe you can see glimpses of them but that s about it now that was a problem for me
the descent managed to show the monster s faces and they were pretty ugly in this movie you can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end i must admit that i had some fun with this movie i will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one
i must confess i don t get a lot of his films but i adored spring summer fall winter and spring again
now i see that this man just comes from a different place with his stories
he is not trying to be commercial
he is brave enough to make some weird stuff but without formulaic endings and feel good clich s
the man is stretching the boundaries of our perception and disturbing our sensibilities enough to make us remember what we just saw whether we liked it or not
for that i give him his due hwal is another zen story in my eyes but with a bit of shamanism as well
the imagery is once again luscious with buddhism and nature with beautiful korean traditional wedding costumes also
the old man and young girl thing disturbed me to no end but that was the intent
there was something sincerely loving between them even though one s moral sensibilities are assaulted from the get go
as the young man enters the picture in what would seem a more appropriate love interest the conflict begins
just as things start to seem to turn normal the magic begins and the spiritual enters the mundane like an old korean fairy tale
sorority house massacre starts as beth angela o neill arrives at her friends sorority house to stop over for the weekend to see whether she will join the house herself linda wendy martel sara pamela ross tracy nicole rio all intend to have heaps of fun over the forthcoming weekend
however things take a turn for the worse almost immediately when beth starts to suffer from graphic terrifying dreams hallucinations
meanwhile in a nearby mental asylum convicted mass murderer robert john c russell manages to escape thanks to some very slack security procedures unknown to the girls robert brutally murdered his entire family in they re sorority house except his sister who hid from him
can you guess who his sister is
can you guess what robert intends to do what happens during the remainder of sorority house massacre
of course you can it s hardly rocket science is it written directed by carol frank sorority house massacre is one of the lamest poorest rubbish s slashers money can buy only really succeeds in confirming that a woman can make a horror film every bit as bad as a bloke
where to start
basically this is one massive dull unoriginal routine bland forgettable boring just plain bad waste of celluloid it s as simple straight forward as that folks
on a personal level there is nothing that i enjoyed about sorority house massacre it s full of clich s annoying teenage character s lame death scenes bad dialogue situations happenings that make no sense plus it s extremely slow boring
it takes itself far too seriously like the filmmakers thought they were making something profound meaningful hey guys you weren t
there s a whole sub plot thing about being psychically linked which was as interesting plausible as it sounds basically not very
sorority house massacre is the sort of slasher film to give slasher films a bad name as if the slasher sub genre didn t have enough of one already i can t remember enjoying any single aspect of this film
at all director frank doesn t do much to liven the film up it doesn t have much in the way of style or visual quality it s very very dark
the entire film is set in one house i just have to ask how many times can you have your character s run up down the stairs before it begins to get tiresome
there are so many things that i didn t like about this film i could go on all day long but i think you get the idea i don t like sorority house massacre at all
forget about much gore every person who is killed in this film is dispatched the same way
everyone is stabbed there s no variety to the murders there s a distinct lack of exploitation blood
there s a bit of nudity but if that s what you want go hire some porn out technically sorority house massacre actually isn t too bad could even be described as being quite well made it s just a shame the film overall sucks so bad
the acting was neither here nor there average at best sorority house massacer is yet another cheap low budget piece of crap from executive producer roger corman s new concorde pictures i sat there openly willing it to finish i was that bored
total crap i just about hated every lame boring minute of it there are loads more much better slasher films out there for anyone to be bothering with such a crap film such as sorority house massacre
one to avoid
i m not sure why but a sequel sorority house massacre ii turned up a few years later i ve seen it yes it s an improvement but not by much
that s the kind of movie you watch without too high expectations and then it totally blows you away and you can t turn it off and at the end you wish you could know what s going to happen now
the story is not really award worthy young brilliant criminal buries the wife of a rich man to get some money and then he gets interrogated by a female cop
but the actors are just great adrien brody shows his evil face and you got really scared of him and maura tierney we know that she can play we saw it a thousand times at er but the role of the depressive drinking cop seems to fit her absolutely perfect
you just have to watch her throwing her life away getting pulled in that turmoil of herself deeper with every minute
you want to save her but you know even if you had the possibility to get to know her in real life you couldn t because in a sick way it fascinates you to just watch
and the chemistry between her and brody is amazing after the first meeting of both you are not able to turn this movie out
i loved it it s my favorite movie and whoever appreciates the talent of maura tierney you will love it too
the movie is awful no two ways about it
the directer and the screenplay writers have completely killed the story
this movie is based on chitra devakaruni banerjee s novel by the same title
go read the book
chances are you are going to hate the movie even more after reading the book
i don t even want to waste my time explaining what went wrong with the movie but this is the worst adaptation of a book i have ever seen
i am amazed how did the writer allow her book to be so badly adapted into a movie
the writers have killed all the essential elements of the book which made the book good
the film instead is nonsensical and even ridiculous
don t waste your time watching the movie
buying the book would be a better utilization of your time and money
stuart little is back in an all awful sequel and this time he s a boy scout
it s funny how nature is seen in this movie as a playground meant to be tame and fun for city people with no idea of how to distinguish a pine tree from a mushroom
the cougar portrays of course the forces of evil who must be tracked down and vanquished by a goody goody lab rat and a cat who acts more like an overgrown guinea pig than a cat
the parents are as usual a goofy happy pair with the father who sees vicious vampire skunks and rabid chipmunks behind every single slimy toadstool and the mother who smiles and cleans up the mess without complaining
seeing the commercial for this movie you know you ll be disappointed with the special effects
if you ve never seen an indiana jones movie crouching tiger hidden dragon seven years in tibet nor any other hk flick then maybe this movie will entertain you
actually comparing this to indiana jones crouching tiger and seven years in tibet would be insults to those movies
more appropriate would be relic hunter legend of zu and the golden child
the storyline starts out decent enough but right off the bat you ll see some hokey f x
for the first half of the movie the plot unfolds like many jackie chan away from hk flix reluctant hero naive sibling overly evil caucasian
the next paint by numbers hk flik characteristic the ol you wanna pull your hair out why did he do that stupid thing thing
that leads to the action part of the movie and off they go to china beautiful scenery a la crouching tiger interspersed with relic hunter antics
but then the almost entertaining movie for a hk flik just got taken over by people who received new computers for christmas it became computer graphics overlayed with the actors swinging on ropes
you d expect the cheesy latest tech graphics in hercules or xena because they re spoofs but this movie ended up like legend of zu graphics fluff
oh the scenes at the end in tibet
nice travelogue
conclusion
do you need to ask
this ain t no crouching tiger hidden dragon the western audience is looking for
watching anatomy of a murder is as intriguing as watching anatomy of a traffic ticket
i wanted to like this film
after all it has a great cast based on a provocative novel at the time
the problem is it s slow illogical and no twist and turns to make the two plus hours invested worthwhile
it ends on a whimper with the only response that is appropriate is huh or is that all there is
lee remick is perfect as the horny slutty wife of military man ben gazaarra
he also is well cast
george c scoot fares better as a member of the prosecution team than jimmey stewart does as the poor as a church mouse defense attorney
jimmy does his mr smith goes to wasington act and it gets very close to over the top at times
and the verdict simply does not pass the smell test
as piece of nostalgia this certainly is of interest
after all it was a time when the word panties was risqu in films
yet when all is said and done it is a pedantic court room drama with lots of court room and little drama
yes
this movie is a re make of an original french movie taxi in case you didn t know and a pretty bad one
if you are too lazy to read subtitles well then i guess you are better off with this us trashy version
if you are not then get the original from with samy naceri and peugeot
it is sooo much better the problem here is that for some reason the bank gang just had to be a bunch of out of control russian models
yes
beacouse that is going to happen
this movie is just an inch from these evil mafia walking around naked it is hardly believable at all plus i am sorry but queen latifah is not really convincing as a racer person and in to the car kind of a person sorry folks i say you could just put less money into dubbing the original than throwing them away for a poor try out
i am not saying all this just because i am from europe
the belgian comedy l iceberg is such a head scratching little oddity that it is virtually impossible to describe it for anyone who hasn t already seen it
it s a highly stylized tale of a young restaurant manager who decides to break away from her stultifying and humdrum existence after she inadvertently locks herself in a freezer overnight only to discover once she gets out that her husband and their two carbon copy young children have failed to notice her absence
realizing her utter insignificance to those around her fiona strikes out on her own abandoning her job and staying away from home for long stretches of time eventually setting out to sea with a mysterious deaf mute sailor she meets along the way utilizing concepts straight out of the theater of the absurd l iceberg pokes fun at the sterility of modern life as fiona finally breaks free of the bonds of domesticity and goes on a quest for love and adventure
directors dominique abel and fiona gordon who play the husband and wife in the film have composed their film almost entirely of straight on block shots perfect for emphasizing the surreal spareness of the drama and setting
the lanky bug eyed gordon who looks for all the world like a cross between frances mcdormand and a stringy haired olive oyl plays fiona with a mouth breathing deadpanned seriousness that enhances our empathy for the character and heightens the satirical nature of the piece original in concept and bold in execution l iceberg is irrepressibly imaginative and visually inventive in its cockeyed portrayal of the world around us
being the second entry into the fleischer brothers studios line of superman cartoons the mechanical monsters fleischer studios paramount pictures corporation was released for theatrical exhibition to the movie going public in november of
this gave it the distinction of being on the theatre screens when the sunday morning sneak attack on pearl harbor on december th clearly this would mark an abrupt change of direction that the series would be taking as the fleischer animation operation would join in with the rest of hollywood in the war effort
the story lines from hence forth would be as populated with nazi soldiers imperial japanese agents and th column saboteurs as the were with all of those mad scientists much in the same manner as the other entries into the superman series there is no wasting of time
the trouble with the giant metal creatures are in progress of wreaking their brand of havoc on the good folks of metropolis when the cartoon short opens
they are in the middle of an in progress menace
much of the necessary exposition is put into place by means of headlines in the daily planet
a clever use of the visual medium as the inclusion of any title cards would be considered strictly pass and a throwback to the days of the silent movies
for all of the magnificent scientific marvels that were embodied in the invention of the giant metal robots the mad scientist is concerned only in looting bank vaults pillaging jewelry establishments and repelling attacks from tommy gun wielding uniformed coppers
perhaps this is due to poor pay working conditions and lack of employment opportunities for brilliant albeit mad scientists that they are forced to supplement their meager incomes through such unlawful means furthermore no one ever has truly explained just what makes these eggheads so mad anyhow
all kidding aside the short is fast moving well plotted and rendered in such a manner as to be an animated equivalent of a museum quality painting from one of the dutch masters
no schultz i didn t mean the cigars
mechanical monsters comes complete with all the accoutrements that are needed in a series entry
first of all the above mentioned renegade scientist is there for starters along with some spectacular method of exacting the plunder on an otherwise helpless metropolis
the regular daily planet gang gets involved in the natural manner coming to the danger with hopes of getting a scoop miss lois lane in order to have a chance to scoop the other scoopers gets a little too close and is abducted unwittingly by the baddies having slipped and fallen into the iron giant s convenient and cavernous trunk space
what s an editor to do
she seems to get caught up in similar fashion time and time again
speaking of recurring patterns superman manages to save the day saving miss lane and her headline story
all s well that ends well especially in metropolis as the episode closes out with a wink from clark kent to the audience we suppose that we could brand the superman cartoons as being formula and even clich d but that may not be fair either for after all the fleischer famous studios productions were essentially blazing new trails in the field of the animated movie
whereas here to for virtually all of the animated cartoon out put was done using highly caricatured human characters anthropomorphic talking animal s characters or both
the idea of writing an action adventure story featuring realistically rendered human characters in fantastic albeit serious short subjects hadn t been done before unless it would be highly obscure
the fleischer superman series changed all of that by paving the way for so many of those adventure cartoons that we have enjoyed over the years on saturday morn
like most of the rest of this series we rate it very high on the scale note we can think of walt disney s fantasia walt disney productions rko radio puctures as being an exception several of the segments having been done in a realistic style
are there any others

it is not true that invisible men have to blind
it it true that light passes through the retina of an invisible man but in most invisible man movies i ve seen one way of locating an invisible man is using night vision goggles witch show the sub red part of electromagnetic spectrum
this fact suggests that whatever turned him invisible it rendered him hollow only to so called visible part of electromagnetic spectrum with wavelenght between and nm
shifting the range of wavelenght sight to sub red nm to mm during the process of making invisible could produce a proper seeing or even better invisible man and last but not least the invisibility in james bond die another day works only from a long distance and uniform background
otherwise changing the point of view will uncover hidden object
this comedy was touching scathing and educational
the film addresses the stereotyping of latinos and the tremendous economic power the latin population has in the state of california
few films are brave enough to take on this sort of subject matter
we see the decimation of the police force agriculture and the entertainment biz
but the message is not given in a preachy or cynical style
it s a really great movie for younger audiences because the satire has tremendous heart
it s good for adults too because it s biting and intelligent
tremendously entertaining and informative
i loved the surprise ending and the basic message that family is not defined by blood alone
i really don t know why eddie murphy signed on to do this movie
the script was terrible and he didn t seem to be trying in the least
when i m watching a movie that tries to be funny and fails i can usually at least see where they were trying to make me laugh
he however i couldn t see one instance where murphy was trying to be funny
i did laugh a few times but it was at the surprisingly funny randy quaid as his robot bruno and the brief apperence of john cleese
ever since the mid s i have had a nostalgia for woody allen s early films
everyone needs to grow it s just that i think woody has grown in the wrong direction
in the films that followed annie hall he seemed to be trying to be bergman at times and fellini at others when i always thought he was better just being woody
why
because he was funny and this film is the funniest of them all this is woody at his zaniest his most anarchic his most irreverent his wildest
it is zany in the same sense that the marx brothers were at their height
he isn t afraid to have segments that are just plain crazy and unbelievable
i wonder if david reuben realized that woody was actually mocking his book when he sold the rights
a classic

a small group of dimwitted poachers stumble upon a cache of strange looking eggs stashed in a cave
one of them gets killed by an unseen creature
then a young boy with a weird girly voice and a menagerie in his bedroom discovers one of the over sized eggs and takes it home to hatch it
meanwhile the worlds worst rock band decides to go camping in the same woods
when the sluttiest girl in the group runs afoul of both poachers and unseen creatures and takes a plunge off of a cliff the unmusical losers take refuge in the house of molly and her husband
brother
who knows
and her young son the same boy who has just hatched an alien creature called trumpy out of the egg he found in the woods
trumpy looks like a cross between a plucked turkey and a vacuum cleaner and does a lot of dippy things like levitating toys and allowing the cat to play with his nose
when people start turning up dead with strange glowy marks upon their foreheads it seems to be the work of trumpy
but soon the truth becomes apparent there is another creature on the loose in the woods killing anyone who crosses his path
this is a very stupid film
even with the assistance of joel and the bots this is still a very painful viewing experience
none of the actors can act and none of the characters are likable at all
all of the girls are either sluts bitches or doormats and all the men are jerks
the plot is nonexistent the script seems to have been written by an imbecile it just roundly sucks
avoid it unless it s the mst version
or unless you re a complete masochist
i don t go in for comic books or their hero s but this is a real early gem
original funny sad and doesn t take itself too seriously with a cute daughter with glasses it hit all the right coaker peck notes
perhaps the worst film i ve seen in a long time
all cliche all the time
leslie nielson plays his airplane naked gun etc
etc
character judge reinhold is awful and those are the good things abut this bomb
jack smight must have been distressed at getting such cheesy directorial assignments such as airport and a few years later this weak science fiction entry
once a solid tv director with a few interesting feature films to his credit smight s resume tailed off in the s with lame titles such as damnation alley a second feature if there ever was one
survivors of the nuclear holocaust roam the desolate wasteland in a futuristic van searching for others
nice to know in the future we ll still have second rate casinos in this country equipped with slot machines circa
one revolting sequence involving blood sucking cockroaches might have become a classic among splatter aficionados had the special effects budget been larger when the roaches en masse chase jan michael vincent on his cycle it looks like a carpet being pulled along by a wire
the cast of actors george peppard and jackie earle haley among them do ok work in an obviously inferior product
from
hainan ji fan shown in the u s with the title rice rhapsody was written and directed by kenneth bi
it stars sylvia chang as jen the proprietor of a chinese restaurant in singapore jen s professional life is going well but she is depressed because her two older sons are gay and she believes her youngest son may be gay as well
the script introduces an outside character sabine played by m lanie laurent who is a french foreign exchange student living with the family the plot is fairly predictable the gay sons are very gay the rival chef who wants to marry jen is very persistent and the exchange student is very sophisticated and very french
unfortunately the movie goes in several directions
when you read the promotional material you expect sabine s relationship to the family to be pivotal
actually her character sort of drifts in an out making worldly and adorably french comments as she goes past
without that plot anchor the film more or less drifts aimlessly along to a hollywood style conclusion however singapore is for me an exotic and unknown location and i enjoyed the fabulous views of the city
the cooking scenes were very well handled and the acting was solid
production values were high this film was shown as a mm print which i think is the best way to see it
it will work on dvd but not quite as well
it s not worth making a great effort to seek out the movie but it s still worth seeing
we saw it at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival
during his early career fabian had some extraordinary luck to get to work with such screen immortals as bing crosby john wayne stewart granger and james stewart in between turning out fluff for the teenage market
as his teen idols had passed him by fabian must have wondered where those other guys were and how he could get into another film with any one of them while doing maryjane
the plot here s been done a gazillion times before for the drive in trade
fabian s a new art teacher assigned to the small town high school where a clique of cool kids rule the school
the cool kids are headed by rich and spoiled kevin coughlin who can always get a good supply of marijuana which of course is spanish for maryjane and its got a lot of other nicknames as well
fabian s of a different generation than the older teachers and he admits to actually trying the stuff once
that gets him down as marked man for law enforcement
but it doesn t score him any points with coughlin and company fabian s got other problems as well he s trying real hard to romance another teacher diane mcbain but she turns frigid on him
and he s trying hard to help young michael marotta who wants so desperately to fit in with coughlin s bunch if you ve seen these teen drive in dramas before you know pretty much how it will all end
except for mcbain she s a bit of a shocker especially considering the times
let s just say that this woman has some real issues maryjane did not revive fabian s career in hollywood when good teen idols are pass they usually stay pass
what he wouldn t have given for another film with jimmy stewart right about then
this was one of the most dishonest meaningless and non peaceful of the films i have ever seen
the representation of the other of the israelis was racist backward and unfair
for one the song played on e s car radio when pulled up alongside a very right wing israeli driver was i put a spell on you by natacha atlas
the song s style is quite arabic but it was released on an israeli compilation cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel
many israeli songs as well as architecture foods and slang are influenced by arabic culture and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song
the way e s
appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare via a long still shot is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist and e s
as noble and temperate i have traveled all over israel and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster since service is mandatory
but in the film not only is there a recruitment poster but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words want to shoot this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers and such an advertisement wouldn t even exist on a random israeli highway
in including it the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti arab racists hell bent on murder the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent
a hollywood style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israeli directed film as the ninja scene should have been
but for some reason images of an unrealistic non comic and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome
the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges portraying the other as human or working towards peace violence is made to be the only solution
this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction
one of my best friends serves in the israeli military and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black or any other quasi civilian on canvas
soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger the method according to my friend is to provide a warning shout fire into the air or around the area and then if all else fails shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize
arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head as shown in the film is not the proper procedure besides these inaccuracies the directing style was also poor
repetition became repetitious and no longer captivating
symbols such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem and it is created for no reason by e s
the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director
the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill showing the routines of random people over and over again even with a slight change each time and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes the dreariness of life without allowing much room for personal interpretation
by contrasting one section of the movie daily life in nazareth with the second section the checkpoint between ramallah and israel the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly and why many modern fashion show like and metal action tracks were included in the score
i still cannot come up with an answer
i felt that the music was out of place in this film the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought provoking
i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint albeit defiantly
in fact i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes
whatever the director s intent it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to actually address any issues
it is a propaganda film because the director intends various symbols styles and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception the vibrant atmosphere of an action packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side
there is no thought reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept there in a good vs bad clich scenario
i believe this film lacked the depth quality and power of other palestinian films such as paradise now and wedding in the galilee
after wasting my time on this pathetic movie i have made a decision not to ever watch another movie with sara jessica parker
she has continued the exact same one dimensional acting in every single part she has ever played this movie being no exception
she can t seem to get past playing carrie no matter what the subject matter
one of the previous posters rightfully acknowledged sjp s habit of clutching at her abdomen and chest for effect in every single role she plays
her high pitched screaming in every performance is the most irritating of all
i wonder how she continues to be cast in movies when she has no range as an actress while watching this movie i had the feeling that they must have rushed the production just to get it made
there are tons of errors and hardly a single thought is completed
all of the actors seem as though they would rather be somewhere else
it is not funny clever or entertaining
don t be drawn in by the trailer or any previews of this movie
it is the bottom of the barrel
if you haven t seen the beatty bening remake of an affair to remember don t
this review is for readers who have seen the original and know the basic premise
i was drawn to the movie because of bening i enjoy her other films but this one is a mockery of her talent
the on screen chemistry between her and warren just isn t there
the taboo of engaged couples cheating on one another is stale and the premise that bening selflessly gets on with her life after her accident is implausible in today s world
the chance that beatty would have a little auntie even if that auntie is katherine hepburn living on a tropical island that just happens to be close to where the plane he was flying in makes an emergency landing is too much of a coincidence even for a fairy tale
this movie is beyond real
the jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place
as for the tear jerker ending warren can t even come close to replicating the look on cary grant s face when he realizes the devastating truth about deborah kerr
oh what i d give for a really good love story
as a fan of the extreme japanese cinema i was really excited to finally get my hands on this film
but it was simply not worth the wait
the film is very slow and boring and as a matter of fact i had to fast forward most of the film
also most of the film s action is in the last minutes and even when you finally reach that point of the film you are simply not interested anymore
it would have been way better if they had cut out about minutes of the film
and also the scene at the end where a guy goes crazy is far too long
we dont need to see the guy jumping up and down for minutes to understand there is something wrong with him
a mediocre film rather predictable film not helped by lazy imagineering work on the spoken form of the alien language it consists simply of lists of swahili words read from a phrasebook and distorted by some kind of vocoder
plain to anyone who knows the language
when i saw the box i thought i was in for a very big action fighting movie dang was i in for a big surprise here is what you are in for if you rent and fall for this very different movie that seemed like a very non u s a made film with very lazy camera work stupidish dialog very weak atmosphere and very little action that seems really poor planning that doesn t work
in the beginning you see these two guys arguing about nothing the one guy says bs about times
its like he wanted your attention or that was his favorite thing to say
and then we see gary daniels fight this chunky guy the camera poorly shows them fight like almost the whole time we only saw a part of their body s plus the camera was sideways and nearly upside down
there is a lot more of this great camera work in other parts of the film
on the box gary daniels has a katana sword i didn t see him use it in the film where in the heck was it and according to the box his family is in a house and he wanted to get them out because bad guys were going to blow the home up and after all of the fighting you never saw him get them out or at the end or at any time at all
daniels talks to this guy who in prison on a filthy bench for plus minutes what a waste of film and time is all the guy was talking about was i gotta stop taking drugs and get out of here if i wanted to a conversation like that i ll talk to my next door neighbor
there was so much silly talk some of the worst camera work and it looks like some one was rubbing the color on the film oh it was so messed up it looked like this was a practice feature instead of a movie i can t even describe how horrible the score and music was
this movie was so dang bad i laughed and laughed and i said i can t believe this that someone actually made a film like this what a terrible piece of film i just can t believe it its some of the worst i have seen do you believe me if not just rent black friday and see for yourself black friday is one of best of the worst films ever made
so the bottom line is if you like really bad films this is thing is for you otherwise if want a really big time action flick but i rented black friday and gave the film another chance
the results was that it made me laugh even more
the fight scene between gary daniels and co fight coordinator tsuyoshi abe was even funnier in the green lighted car garage
the scene was a slow fight but daniels delivers with a great kick with a mean look on his face to the sturdom area of tsuyoshi abe s character as he hits the wall hard
the conversation on the bench did last almost fifteen minutes
the villain i thought was better than before but he still said bs about six times during the beginning the music was very bizarre but yet it grows on you as the films goes on
i am glad i saw black friday again
its an action film that s serious but make you laugh which is fine with me
no one alive will convince me mike pipper isn t steve smith better known as character red green on the red green show
yeah i realize he s billed as ron anderson iii
that s red green unless like of canadians look and sound like red green the movie is about some dork who s dorky father was killed by a dorky cult
the dork snoops around and finds his dorky father s notes on a dorky cult
dork investigates
not surprisingly the entirety of canada must be part of the dorky cult because somehow they show up at dork s house looking for dork and the notes
dork escapes and meets bigger dork
chasing continues and rather bland uninteresting dialogue ensue until they run into red green
right around this time dork finds out that bigger dork used to be in the cult and in fact may have killed his father
dohwell didn t expect that now did we
in the end some dork ends up burning and some really dorky thing happens
perhaps the oddest thing is the apparent alien abduction of about of the dorky cult members
i couldn t really figure out what exactly took place and how this fit into the err story
perhaps they were walking towards the light
the story is horrible acting is terrible there are no effects and the script is st to none
the only thing i can say there are actually quite a few motion cinema shots
that s about the only thing that get s this film a
it s dated
i seriously wonder how many decades this sat finished before release

it is said that this human race is always progressing but after a point all is destroyed and god will again create it from the very beginning
so i can imagine that it is not possible that this kind of movie can be made again ever
the world has to be created again by god and only than this kind of movie can be made
i slute shakti samant sahib and his team for their eternal contribution to the society
it is not possible that these people will born again for thousands of years
this film also shows indains have talent and qualities as these people were born and brought up in india and were indian by heart i admire mughl e azam but in mughal e azam there is king armies and glamour to support the story line and creenplay but amar prem is purely natural and close to common man therefore it is a lesson and a great satire on our society specially in the subcontinent
so i watching tv
on the net and i came across this show called reaper
i immediately became intrigued because it seemed like the title of show that could possibly be somewhat interesting
however from what i ve seen this show is nothing but a rip off on dead like me which was made five years earlier
it has the same idea of a young person being torn from normal life and being forced to deal with the question and curiosities of death
the only difference between the two shows is that this reaper works for the devil and this show is not funny and the actors leave much to be desired
if you like this type of stuff tastefully morbid and ironic things then i highly recommend you check dead like me out
it is only amazing
i found this to be a very entertaining musical with some decent mixture of songs comedy and romance
there are no less than three leading ladies and they all look good
two of them are big names irene dunne and ginger rogers there s fred astaire in here too so i guess we can call this another astaire rogers film if so i think it s one of their best and certainly one of their most underrated
you don t hear much about this movie and that s unfair rogers and astaire both have some funny lines in this film and i wish ginger s role had been bigger
she and astaire do a couple of tap dance numbers that are excellent some of their best work together
dunne s first two songs aren t bad but you have the rest
her soprano voice almost broke my eardrums especially with smoke gets in your eyes randolph scott helen westley and claire dodd also star in this dated but generally fun movie
i m not going to try call the art where are thee
because avatar isn t trying pretend to be deep anyway
however i m very concerned about the amount of the reviews here at imdb
it probably shows something
people don t think anymore they want candy
so they got it
but you can t feed on candy only you know
at the time when i m writing this review avatar sits on the th position of the top between th silence of the lambs and th once upon a time in the west
if this won t change it s quite obvious where the top on imdb is going ok so why it sucks story main character jake infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet
this tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral
the tribe must be wiped out because of it
jake starts to like his new friends because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature
he also fell in love with female alien nscho tschi er neytiri
battle between humans and aliens
the end
well not only has been this around thousand times over and over again but it go figure
might have taken some bits from the history as well
dances with wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and i can think of even more accurate example enemy mine
wiping the native americans was a damn shame from any angle but please we all have got the point that it was wrong ok
get over it and don t breed the hate among the dumb mooing cattle
if you need some movie history lesson from this area go see the little big man the plot is exactly the same only you won t need the d goggles script none
the pattern could have been written by anybody who has seen the standard action flicks
first few minutes we get the direct explanation about what where who and why
and you know this type of explanation right
actors talking to each other and explaining the situation like they never met before
the lecture from parker selfridge giovanni ribisi given to dr grace augustine sigourney weaver why
in their first dialog raised my palm to my face
the intellect of the audience has been lowered down again
then standard romantic part with a twist in second part the main character is obviously the chosen one because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too
the aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them
duh actors and setting who the hell need actors when we ve got cgi
i was in the theater with my brother who plays computer games a lot
after we came out of the building he named me several things which have been taken out straight from several pc games like command and conquer heroes of might and magic warcraft and so on
so another rip off
visual effects you ve got this right
but wait another years
it s like silicon breast
now it looks good on your years old body but wait another
i still can t believe the score on imdb is based solely on visual effects
it s so wrong i have a theory about the whole thing
i think cameron has been paid a fortune to do this
why
let s say the movie entertainment industry has a problem that people don t go to theaters anymore because they can watch movies from home especially when they can get it on piratebay right
so the industry needs a new type of movies
movies with lame story lame script lame everything but top cgi d imax ultra mega realistic screening so the movie downloaded from the internet is in fact useless
i ve got nothing against this strategy
i don t give a damn about these mindless flicks but they just don t belong among the top that s why i went to see avatar
out of curiosity
and my jaw did drop
from a shame where the intellect of the majority is going
i m also ashamed that i went there and paid the money to see it
it s utterly trash
it s like porn movies
only this time we jerk the eyes
i ve seen hundreds possibly thousands of movies
i sat through the abomination that was tomb raider
i watched the blindness producing torque all the way through
but this this was just unwatchable i love action martial arts movies who doesn t
but this is just awful
first it starts off with some exciting action then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap with a giant a wizard and a monkey man yes i m being serious once we met the wizard i turned it off
no action in the world was good enough to make me keep watching this movie had some truly awful acting even for thai movies this was bad
the action
boring with one or memorable scenes which i already saw on the trailer
the hero
only uses his knees
watching him kick the crap out of people the same exact way for minutes gets boring fast special effects
my god they were bad i mean we had the hero riding a rocket like a surfboard christ almighty can you believe that crap
i feel stupider just having watched this movie i urge you to save some brain cells and skip it
watch ong bak watch tom yum goong heck watch em twice just don t watch this movie inferno
this is an extremely funny movie
jamie kennedy is awesome
i always laugh hard at this movie
kennedy plays brad b rad g gluckman the rapper wannabe son of bill gluckman is running for the office of governor of california
he shows up at his dad s campaign and starts rapping
members from the campaign hire two black actors named sean and pj to scare b rad into acting like a white boy again
pj gets his smokin hot cousin shondra to help but b rad is hard to change
b rad finds out it s not real and begins to take matters into his own hands but when a real gangsta named tec holds the actors and b rad hostage bill gluckman forgets his campaign and tries to find his son along with b rad s wannabe gangsta friends
if you love comedy jamie kennedy and da hood you ll love malibu s most wanted
here is a movie i ve been a fan of since it s release in
gary oldman is the gem of this film
he plays a long haired irish american thug in new york s hells kitchen employed by an irish mob headed by his brother played by ed harris
this group is backed by the italian mafia and ed harris s character is always trying to impress the mob chiefton
sean penn plays gary oldmans child hood friend and fellow gangster who left town one day years ago without notice
now he s back and welcomed heartily
without question he is accepted back into the gang and put to work
only problem is when he left he went to boston to become a cop and now he s undercover and infiltrating his old friends
a tale of loyalty betrayal and murder done with a style befitting a new york gangster flick
and for irish americans such as myself it s a great movie to drink to on st patty s
this is a good film with a solid cast full of action and drunken irishmen which leads to one of the best endings to any movie ever a bar room shoot out with new york s st patrick day parade as the back drop
if this movie had a flavor it would taste like whiskey
speaking of whiskey i have been celebrating st patricks day every year since by downing several glasses of jameson and viewing state of grace now thats irish
ok i will admit that since i am descended from mary boleyn and most likely henry viii i do have a bit of family honor at stake here i knew the film was going to take liberties with historical truth but really
the other boleyn girl is almost pure fiction from beginning to end
why did they bother to tack on some accurate historical outcomes in written sentence form of the characters at the end just before the credits rolled
just to name a couple of examples mary boleyn was married to william carey as depicted and henry took her as his mistress with carey s approval as he was richly rewarded
maybe emotionally conflicted approval i don t know
i rather doubt it
anyway in the film mary marries a commoner at the end
the film never explains what happened to carey it would seem to suggest she is committing bigamy
in the closing write over we read that mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy in fact her family looked down on her and even rejected her because she brought down their status
she suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage but was still glad she finally married for love
other things that are totally false anne and mary did not hang out all the time as is suggested in the film i understand that serves the plot well so maybe i will let that one go
can t let this one go henry raping anne before she surrendered to him
that is ridiculous
and anne convincing her brother to have incest with her so as to produce an heir
that is even more ridiculous
she would never have broken the incest taboo also if henry was really shunning her bed by that time as anne suggests in the film then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the tower
speaking of being sent to the tower in real life anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution likely she was trying to protect her daughter elizabeth and better secure her daughter s future relationship with henry
she was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed
this is not at all how anne is portrayed in the film
cardinal wolsey is left out of the movie entirely and he played a major role in the whole drama of the divorce from catherine of aragon and henry s desire for anne boleyn
i just don t see why this same type of movie could not have been made with fictional kings and queens and other characters no authentic names
then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating
of course it could not then claim to be based on gregory s book about mary boleyn
i don t plan to read that there are too many accurate books about henry viii that are no doubt more interesting and i can read about poor mary boleyn the pushover in those
it has been over thirty years since i first saw this movie and i still remember its effect on me
i bought the novel soon after and read it until the pages fell out
someone asked me at a job interview who my most influential person and i said jacquelyn helton because she had the courage to do what she thought was right all the while knowing what the outcome would be
this movie is an inspiration to anyone who takes life for granted and makes you realize that no matter how long you live whether it is years or a hundred its not the length but the quality of that life make it count and above all else love
like i said my friend and i decided to watch the prince and me and the prince and me back to back to see what they were like
while the second prince and me started off fairly like a sweet movie it turned from a teen audience into a little girl s fantasy world
especially more like a typical disney princess flick that was unbelievable and i couldn t take seriously even for a little kid it takes off where paige is now in denmark and is learning the language the culture and the perks of being a queen including the paparazzi stalking her
she s also studying still to become a doctor
edvard is working hard as well to become a good king and is doing the best he can to contain a good king image
but when an old childhood royal friend kirsten gets in the way of the relationship believing that it should only be royalty who becomes king and queen you can take off with the rest of the plot the new girl who played paige was totally unbelievable as a workaholic study bug and didn t have the same presence and grace as julia styles
the guy who played the prince actually looked irritated to play the role again i think he knew that this film was a mistake
oh well for the little year old girls who love fairy tales this is the film for them let s just pray they don t make a third installment otherwise with all the making out these two do it ll be a porno
of course i m saying that lightly
it s actually not that bad but it could have been better
what they do need to work on is the accessibility of this movie to others watched the dvd and it s the most basic dvd out there
no menu couldn t believe that one standard screen no subtitles no extra s of any kind
basically if you find it on dvd it s one step better than vhs but unless you collect on a actor bases only it s a rental only
ps even in this case the dvd is better than vhs because it ll never get screwed like tapes will
although if you smash it
oopsy
based on a william faulkner story this movie has the dark gloomy but realistic look of his work
the art direction lighting and costume design shows that this is a low budget film but it doesn t make it corny
in fact this adds much to the authenticity of what the south was like in the late s
in addition the film is in black and white this helps make the depressive mood of the story like much of faulkner s writing the film is done in flashback form
it opens with a murder of a young man and the trial of the man who committed the killing
it then goes back twenty years earlier to a poor southern farmer jackson fentry robert duvall is simply wonderful as fentry a man who is cut off from most of the world
his character is lonely but yet a naive and caring individual as he finds an ill pregnant woman olga bellin while working on a farm as a caretaker
he takes her in and cares for her
everything seems normal for awhile but then two tragedies happen they lead up to the present opening of the film
everything is tied in together nicely making a great yet sad ending
it brings up the questions which is better for a child
heredity or environment
this sounds like an excellent film that i would give a
but what made me give it a was the pace
the movie was incredibly slow
this is no action and i knew it wasn t one but the dry drawling southern monotones that the actor s spoke made it boring
i was studying at the university of amsterdam last year when i would pass the movie theater in haarlemstrat sp and see the announcement for the film
i wanted so much to see the film especially because of monic hendrickx but the film was not subtitled yet for english
recently i found it on amazon
it had english subtitles and it was in pal but since i own several pal movies i now own a portable dvd player that plays all regions
alas after a long wait i was not disappointed
it is a celebration of life and i felt inspired by it
i hope this film is more widely recognized because it was perfect in every way
a few years back zeus and zo another dutch film was nominated for the academy awards
i have nothing against z z but leef should not be overlooked
if you liked freaks and geeks this is a must see
judd apatow once again created a hysterical and touching series with characters that really become more like friends
the half hour format makes these a bit lighter than freaks and geeks and when this show was canceled they weren t quite as able to still wrap things up as with the earlier show
but this certainly filled the void in my tv viewing life left by the departure of freaks and geeks
many of the members of the cast from that show appear here some as regulars others in hysterical guest performances
this is definitely one of those watch it in a single weekend marathon kind of shows
i only got this movie because i collect movies that are related to the beer and brewing business as part of my breweriana collection
the connection involving the mumblin jack malt liquor turned out to be very weak although i would like one of the oz bottles used as props for my collection what i got instead was a picture that was a little too real to have you believe it was an attempt at fiction but too fake to have you believe it was real
it was just out there in no man s land let s face it whether it is alcohol and fast food or facial tissue advertising transcends sex religion and race and targets exploits
some group the product is aimed at
it is not the advertisers fault that certain groups tend to buy more of certain products
it s called exploiting a market and that s their job bottom line this is a confusing movie and i would strongly recommend giving it a pass unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors
cast in gray is an extraordinarily poetic work
every aspect of it from the narrative conception to the sense of movement to the editing and not least the cinematography strikes a stunning balance between dazzling clarity and a vague dreamy quality
i found myself clinging passionately to its every moment
how rare that a film nowadays can carry off such daring lyricism holding us in the cup of its hand with an absolute minimum of dialog incident cutting scenic variety or any of the other strategies utilized to make films move along
there is a tough minded discipline to this film that gives it enormous credibility
but it is also a heartbreakingly kind and gentle film
it is truly not to be missed
even casting aside memories of the infamous summer of during which the internet movie database s film general message board was overrun for months by the director s friends relentlessly hawking this documentary and getting extremely unpleasant when challenged about their behaviour trolling the board in a monumentally misguided attempt at viral marketing that ensured everyone who encountered them waited for it to arrive on television rather than pay to see it this film is impossible to like much of that stems from the unlikable brian herzlinger a man with no personality to speak of
he s a poor enough actor to betray the fact that at times he s clearly reading scripted material or improvising imaginary see i got you back phone conversations with an ex girlfriend who cheated on him
and that s not even his most pathetic moment every attempt is made to enliven the concept but because it simply doesn t lend itself to a feature length film these attempts are doomed to failure even if they weren t so hopelessly amateurish and inappropriate
they frequently employ six degrees of separation graphics as if they expect the audience to care that some guy s friend is a friend of some other guy s agent who knows someone who once worked with barrymore
this kind of information is often presented in dramatic freeze frames as if to underline how important it is presumably resulting from a dearth of imagination and creativity we re left with seemingly never ending footage of herzlinger approaching teenage girls outside malls and telling them what the film s about
oh cool they respond unenthusiastically and this footage made the final cut
next we see him unsuccessfully stopping people in the street and asking them to take part in a survey about drew barrymore it continues like this until the final scene which i won t spoil
things get mildly interesting and decidedly awkward for a few minutes and then thankfully it s over
ah the old days when movies were really really bad
no wait this was made this year hmm wow i didn t think a movie about the great american dream versus the evil empire tm c could hold water no longer the evil u s s r now it gets to be china
nor one of those shows about how the evil alien which is about to kill everyone in the world and suddenly learns to love us because some w r scientist kisses some gal in the heat of the moment and leaves despite the fact that it s been shot full of holes by missles and been exposed to nothing but a constant stream of violence from the majority of the dominant human population remember we are great while dinosaurs sucked
or one where the military so predictably wants to blow up the thing we don t understand with a nuke ordered by a panicked president even though the resident scientist who s of course a totally smug jerk says not to
how do these awful movies keep getting made
isn t it possible for someone to present a good non predictable plotline to a hollywood producer and actually have it made
sigh not going to happen i guess
coach roy martin lawrence is a famous college basketball coach who s anger leads him to a indefinite suspension from the league
his life is spirals downhill and ends up coaching the middle school that he used to attend s basketball team once again martin lawrence proves himself to be a horrible actor
i can honestly say i have only enjoyed one of his movies blue streak
and now he takes a totally different approach the family movie
martin when will you learn
you are not funny unless you are absolutely vulgar
besides martin lawrences performance the movie was actually not the worst kid s movie ever
i laughed at a few of the kid s remarks just never at martin lawrence
the movie can be very closely related to like mike starring lil bow wow but the scenes in which they place basketball are not even as exciting
overall the movie is not anything worth watching even for a family film i do not recommend this movie
this is a pretty disappointing movie coming on the heels of alan arkin and peter falk s terrific performance in the in laws
that was a great movie
this is not
it seems like the entire production was under financed and thrown together
the production values are sloppy
in one scene you can actually see the lighting cables and c stands as the stars chase through a hallway
i can only assume arkin and falk agreed to do this film out of friendship for john cassavettes
this double indemnity parody is just not worthy of any of them though
however there is one great great moment in big trouble that stands out the world s longest spit take
this is done early in the picture when it seems the movie might actually recreate the fun and excitement of the in laws
watch as alan arkin samples some of falk s herring liquor
it s a show stopping side splitting moment but after that stop the tape
there s nothing else worth seeing
an overlooked masterpiece
not only did gillian armstrong s direction serve the material superbly but judy davis s sybilla was one of the boldest film debuts i ve ever seen
the gasps heard all over the theater when sam neill is first seen from sybilla s pov in the tree also made an indelible impression perhaps most impressive is the screenplay which greatly improves on what turned out to be a good novel so dated that it is all the more amazing that anyone ever thought to make it into a film
the musical score was also a delight most confusing to me is that it has taken so long for it to be released on home video
a major addition to any thinking film goer s home library
this delightful female cast brings back to the screen an excellent entertaining funny and dramatic wicked elegance of the full monty phenomenon with a feminine twist
julie waters in a supporting actress oscar performance together with helen mirren easily capture the british wry humor and the typical stuck up attitude of old english propriety its predecessor
there are great moments of laughter and sobering moments of reality and realization of sacrifice loss betrayal
one of the best movies of the year
nine out of ten stars
this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep utterly boring long silent yes silent strings of unrelated video clips instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing arabs being malicious to everyone around them sulieman the director should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film it deserves a one for the movie quality a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script or lack thereof
this was almost exactly like a run of the mill porn movie except there was precious little porn in it except for at couple of bare boobs shots what with the incredibly bad acting utterly pointless plot and ridiculous scenes completely unrelated to the rest of the story case in point the singing hippie priest avoid at all cost

the godfather citizen kane star wars goodfellas none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos
each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional
we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil
soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history
if you re in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos
i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season and not want to continue with the series
each season is completely brilliant in its own way
dvds are essential to anybody s collection of out
it was wonderful of fran drescher to open up her spectacular malibu home to hold a reunion for the much loved and never forgotten characters of the hit sitcom the nanny although fran still has that somewhat annoying thick queens accent her appearance has dramatically changed since the nanny however with long straight black hair and style still in tact fran drescher makes the s look fabulous and was the gracious host for a nosh to remember a must see for all fans of the nanny
all actors from the nanny were present except for daniel davis niles the butler who unfortunately couldn t make it his absence was noticeable too the stars had a meal together on the balcony overlooking malibu beach as they reflected on memorable moments from the show it was a real treat to see maggie brighton and gracie all grown up and it was obvious that the actors truly formed long lasting friendships during the series that remain in their hearts it was wonderful to see the cast all together again and great to see hilarious and special nanny moments relived again
i had tickets for this at the toronto international film festival last summer but was side tracked by an obscure little film called slumdog millionaire instead so only got around to watching it last night on pay per view
in a strange way the two films have a good deal in common
in an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers puerile comedies or awesome special effects the only one here as has been pointed out is a cheaply put together tornado both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development
but both work remarkably well
i am puzzled by those who found that the movie dragged
while most of the plot development was telegraphed not once but several times the acting from all three leads was both believable and very deft
at first i thought that rachel mcadams character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we or even she knew
she plays it beautifully
tim robbins is wonderful too and rather pathetic in a down to earth role as an aging war veteran happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities
but michael pena was the real surprise
he is completely captivating in his portrayal of a proud young vet from a military family on his way to meet his girlfriend with his masculinity compromised by a war injury
his character is the most subtly poignant as he confronts his own fears about his manhood on several levels like all movies based on the iraqi war this seems to suffer from america s desire to ignore the war altogether just as they ignored the vietnam veterans a generation ago coming home the deer hunter
america seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then or even the lesser failures in the wake of world war ii
it had to happen someday a movie about people who didn t succeed with their ideas at least they got their fifteen minutes of fame in gizmo the excitement and virtue of creativity is embraced in full as a multitude of inventions from a ways back are shown via newsreels
some are pretty viable indestructable head gear while others are just plain silly inummerable flying machines but all show a lot of imagination behind the madness you have to hand it to the inventors though they were trying to better mankind
at least it wasn t through weapons of war all in all gizmo is a lot of fun for the whole family even
if you can find it rent it or even catch it on tv watch it
especially if none of your ideas ever succeed you ll feel better ten stars
let s hear it for the entreprenurial spirit
the daredevils heroes are gene the brains of the outfit tiny a gifted strongman and bert an agile escape artist
they are aided by carole landis who plays blanche grandville the granddaughter of horace grandville whose multimillion dollar industrial complex is under attack by master criminal
this film is twelve chapters of action packed cliff hanging fun
i particularly liked the fact that these circa daredevils did almost all of their action scenes in double breasted three piece suits
the history of the major actors is quite interesting dave sharpe bert became an army pilot during wwii and a major stuntman having a long and celebrated career in the industry
he has been ranked with the great yakima canutt
charles quigley gene had a good career but died of cirrhosis of the liver before he turned sixty
bruce bennet aka herman brix who played tiny was a olympic champion who went on to a very long career and lived to be over years old
carole landis was when she committed suicide
i bought this film because of the multitude of glowing reviews found on this forum
i was not disappointed
just like moonraker james bond actor roger moore seemed to watch out for a new role opposite to his cool gentlemen like fame
so it s no wonder that his role as rufus excalibur ffolkes is miles away from but it s still moore
after a bunch of high tech terrorists has taken over three oil rigs and threaten to blow them up if the british government won t pay a few million pounds it is moore s turn to save the western world
leading a squad of professional anti terrorist submarine fighters they are planning to storm the rigs running out of time and fighting against thunderstorms and the cleverness of the gangsters the cast is superb with anthony perkins as gang leader playing some kind of crossover between norman bates and the bond villains
supporting roles are played by james mason and david hedison who played bond s american cia sidekick felix leiter two times
the plot is influenced by the rise of modern terrorism and the energy crisis in the seventies but also by the bond films and the fashionable disaster movies of its time the best about the film is roger moore s ffolks a cat loving alcohol drinking women hating bearded englishmen without a sense of humor and gentleness
the pacing is alright and the story keeps the film thrilling until is too fast ending
and while james bond is rewarded with the most beautiful girl after having saved the world ffolkes receives a completely different gift at the end of the film all in all north sea hijack is the perfect action thriller for a stormy and rainy autumn evening in front of your tv set
this film does not show bud and terence at their best
the combination of awful acting awful wigs and superbly irritating synthesizer music all combine to make this film an effort in endurance to stay watching i m not sure where this comes in the bud terence line up of movies but much like the early plot where the two characters team up again for one final mission this movie has the feel of a movie made after the heyday of the pair
perhaps even a film made to reunite the two actors in the hope of regaining the magic of the pairing whatever the reason it doesn t work
the film is a mess and the acting by the non principals is just plain dire
you know the sort of thing advertisement acting quality
add in the lamentably obvious hairpieces which might as well have had neon wig signs above each of them and dubbing which whilst ok in the main only serves to remind you that it is in fact dubbing and you have the recipe for an s movie disaster unfortunately the disaster becomes a calamity of epic proportions when the music is factored in
some bad films benefit from a synthesizer soundtrack hawk the slayer for instance but here the repetitive and it has to be said mindless chord sequences only jar the nerves
anyone who s ever played an arcade machine from the eighties will quickly recognize the type of music that becomes increasingly annoying the more you have to listen to it whilst trying to complete that difficult level as for the plot i was too busy gaping open mouthed at all the wrongness on display to really pay it much heed
some hokum about the pairing teaming up again to complete a previously unfinished mission hmmm the arcade machine analogy again
and much like those difficult to complete games this movie depends for its completion on how many mental dimes you have left to put into it
it really is an exercise in endurance i expect fans of the duo will like it nonetheless but it isn t a patch on my name is nobody and like so many other films of the time it really shows its age now summary mindless miami vice wannabee music hack acting awful wigs and so so dubbing
not recommended except for the most stalwart of fans
my top problems with this movie peter fonda looked like he was on ludes the whole movie especially when his missing granddaughter turns up and he blurts lily
i m so happy to see you
i ve never seen a actor emote less alec baldwin
not that he is bad in this
he seems to be about the only actual actor trying to act
but all i could think of was glengary glen ross
i was dying for him to scream you thoughtless little pig to the lily character
i wonder how far they got into shooting before alec realized what a major piece of crap he was involved in was the native american driving the train supposed to be some sort of lame joke
you know an injun driving an engine
what was he even doing in this movie
the yahoo serious brother or cousin or whatever
simply annoying
although the shell phone joke was good what exactly are the rules about who shrinks and who doesn t when they travel thru the magic railroad
they re definitely not consistent how exactly did patch get all that coal to the cave
the engines are barely in this movie at all
and when they are some speak with a brit accent and others don t
wtf
plus the engine with the most lines diesel isn t even one of the main thomas and friends characters what was diesel doing there in the first place if he was such a pain in the a
the opening sequence at shining time with the james taylor ish music and the juggler was simply lame
at least it was big waving red flag at the beginning of the film alerting me to keep my expectations low what was with lily climbing on things
was it foreshadowing some event that never happened
the whole gold dust concept confused the hell out of me
what it s for where it comes from all of it was frustratingly unclear well i could go on and on
i m not going to cheap out at this point and say but my kid liked it like everyone else
yeah he ll sit and watch it
but he d sit and watch just about anything that had thomas in it and it is a shame that they totally squandered an opportunity to make a decent feature movie with some beloved characters
too bad
blood dolls starts as eccentric billionaire computer developer businessman virgil travis jack maturin discovers he has lost a billion dollars after losing a legal battle leaving him financially ruined obviously not best pleased about losing a billion dollars he sets out to kill his competitors who made it happen as well as the corrupt judge
in his spare time virgil has also created horrible little killer dolls to do his bidding first george warbeck nicholas worth mercy shaw jodie coady are taken care off then virgil turns his attentions to harrison yulin warren draper his scheming wife moira debra mayer who just happens to be a dominatrix has virgil met his match at last written produced directed by charles band made under his full moon company this is yet another killer toy flick one maybe cynically would suggest is more interested in starting a new line of collectible toys than entertaining
band has experience in the killer toy genre dolls puppet master it s sequels unfortunately blood dolls is terrible in pretty much every way
the story is absolutely none existent seriously there is no story to speak of or worth mentioning at all
it s just a few random scenes cobbled together more than a coherent film
there are some really bizarre things in blood dolls for instance a four girl rock band who virgil keeps locked in a cage has them perform songs at regular intervals for no apparent reason
the fact that virgil has an extremely small head there s absolutely no reason for it it looks stupid but it s here anyway
the fact that virgil s servants consist of a guy in clown make up a dwarf add another unusual spin on proceedings without ever making any sense in their own right
then there s the fact that moira is a dominatrix the film comes alive when she goes into mistress mode abuses her husband her scenes are the only reason i m giving blood dolls stars instead of
unfortunately her dominatrix scenes are few far between once her husband is killed off she becomes normal as it were the film then dies a slow painful death
there s also a pointless double ending like in clue where one thing happens then an alternative it could have also happened like this ending is shown which just makes the whole film even more pointless director band was obviously working on a low budget the doll effects are poor they have little movement
there s hardly any blood or gore someone gets bashed over the head with a lifting weight someone gets a scalpel in the eye a guy is killed when wires dig into his flesh a drill burrows into someones chest with lots of blood splatter
otherwise this is virtually bloodless
there s nothing here scary there s no atmosphere or tension the story sucks
apart from a few fun scenes with moira as a dominatrix blood dolls has nothing going for it is utterly forgettable
even the dolls themselves are bland look cheap none of them stand out as being cool or particularly threatening technically the film is basic it appears to be shot in the same few rooms the special effects consist of nothing more than a few plastic dolls moving their arms heads
every so often the rock group perform a song they can t sing all i can say is thank god for the mute button
the acting is ok dominatrix debra mayer steals every scene shes in blood dolls is a cheap poor plot less attempt at starting another killer toy franchise by charles band do yourself a big favour watch puppet master dolls or child s play again instead
apart from mayer s dominatrix scenes this is pretty damned bad as far as i m concerned has nothing going for it
i m not sure how this was accomplished but blood of the vampire is both ghastly and dull
i had taped this off amc during the halloween marathon and finally had a chance to watch it and while it had the look and feel of a hammer movie it was amazingly painfully dull
the fact that dr callistratus is resurrected from the dead is the only supernatural element in the movie and somehow it never becomes an issue or is talked about again
spoiler ahead although the visual elements of the doctor s secret laboratory is stark there is no attempt to generate any fear in this movie
dull dull dull
mild spoilers i had heard that this was a tearjerker but i was completely taken in by the simple story and the incredible relationship between dink and the champ i spent the last half of the movie with tears rolling down my cheeks and i was really struck by a lot of the little details that made the film play much better than a lot of movies nowadays
and i am not saying that all movies today are bad hey i liked the matrix and lord of the rings like everybody else
but there are little moments such as the way they hold hands walking out of the gambling joint or the way beery takes off his son s shoes and gets him ready for bed then sits up and looks out the window in despair over having lost everything at the craps table
just blew me away
the scene in the jail destroyed me as did the final scene
just such amazing characters and you couldn t help but feel for them
beery is such a terrific on screen presence and cooper was just a joy to watch
highly recommended
this film of an earlier play is the proof
there s just too much real absurdity going on
genevieve bujold as the disconnected mother is the best thing in it but these days that isn t saying much because so many people are disconnected
what there is of a plot about sibling incest and insanity is today totally predictable
a few too few funny lines
no one seems to know quite what to do with parker posey except christopher guest in his wonderful mockumentaries in which she s very funny
here she just seems strained
tori spelling is quite appealing as the only normal character a donut shop waitress who lands in a pretentious upscale family
more banality not worth wasting many words on the same inspiration for this show must have been the same inspiration which caused ms grey to transform herself with surgery from a very attractive woman with looks of character to a commonplace plain jane just like jennifer grey s appearance has become commonplace and plain so is this show
not bad but just another show and another face in the crowd
nothing special
i have seen lookwell the television show which was canceled years ago without it been given a chance by nbc
let me tell you that this show would have been bigger than seinfeld married with children er friends everybody loves raymond super bowl vi the larry sanders show live with regis and kelly dallas and live with emeril lagasse combined
ok maybe i m exaggerating but lookwell was the funniest thing i ve ever seen
to my pleasant surprise i found out right on this web site who wrote the script for lookwell
it was a young conan o brien and the guy who does the voice for triumph the insult dog robert smigel
i just pray that that show the little of it that was recorded becomes available on video so that i can buy it
people this was funny with a capitol t americans should be making long lines in macys department stores all across america to kiss conan o brien s robert smigel s and adam west s ass
no animals were hurt during the making of this memo
enough of this let me go make a sandwich
sincerely kneeling frankpenab aol com
you don t leave the theater untouched by this movie
it reached me and didn t let go
i saw this movie five times and for those among you who missed it be sure you can get your hands on a video or dvd it will stimulate al least three of your five senses
i had wanted to see this film for many years
well mainly cause john carradine was in it
it was a movie that i was curious to see
no need to say who s st film it was
well one of his st films i mean
i was quite bored watching it
the acting was as bad as it got
iactually almost bought this piece of crap of a film on dvd a few years ago
now i m glad i did not
so anyone who hasn t seen this film watch it only for curiosity not cause people have said it s good
the nd reason i forgot to mention was the reason i watched it off cable was it s an early film that roger the man corman produced when he had not long before had quit directing films
this is a great movie for those who grew up in the s
i didn t
i wasn t born until but when i was a young tyke i had to see this movie from the moment i saw the tv spot advertising it on television
dad and i went out to the newest theater in austin the four plex was the newest and biggest theater in the austin area with an name to mystify those reading the ads the aquarius it was called
the movie was loaded with all kinds of footage from the s and included in this footage was some ancient looking film clips of the students in high school in hicksville ny
these students were demonstrating good and bad dress codes
on the left of the teacher were the ones dressed poorly with t shirts dungarees open toed shoes etc
and on the right a group of kids that would make today s crowd look like the peanut gallery
in addition to this footage there was other footage showing the fads of the day the cars chuck berry s tour bus sitting in a junk yard and all kinds of things that i had never seen at the age of or so
it was a collage of old films and reminders of an era past that people were trying to remember by the early s
the makers of this film used a technique where they had one inmage on one side of the screen and another image on the other side
so while the footage would roll on the right you would see a modern day chuck berry singing in concert
the film was half concert and half archival footage
it was a great film
the shirelles were in the show live as was little richard fats domino bill haley and chuck berry
the satins did a set too and let us not forget that guitar playing fool bo diddley
bo was there with his rectangular guitar a pimp s hat with a feather and his uniquie timekeeping abilities
it was a memorable show
for some reason the makers of this film never released this again
it isn t on video i have never seen it on television that i know of and all attempts at finding it on my favorite film guage mm are futile
the only thing that i have been able to locate is a tv spot from the movie and this is valuable to me for the reasons above
i recommend this movie highly and i will never forget my experience with having seen this movie
this is not just a kitchen sink film
it s an thriller with an edge a story and believable characters it is a fairly violent film but that violence is given a realistic documentary treatment which is some ways makes it all the more shocking
there is no gore splatter just cold well defined revenge
the trailer did leave me with the impression it was going to be much bloodier but i feel that shane meadows got the balance right paddy considine s script is very good and leaves enough room for the audience to be surprised at the next turn and his portrayal of a vengeful brother is spot on
provided they are happy with the lack of hollywood polish this is a film i d recommend to any lovers of the thriller genre
it s well paced and there are sufficient surprises to keep you guessing throughout overall it kept me well occupied and it gets a good from me
having a child with severe autism i approach every autistic related movie with caution
the trailer pulls on your heartstrings the movie however spells out things that parents and siblings experience on a day to day basis
the movie running at minutes can t ever convey a life with autism but with the director seems to have brought her life experience to the screen in a thoughtful and observant way small observations only people touched by autism would recognise and find funny and painful
im not sure if viewers with no experience would understand these which is the most heartbreaking aspect of the whole movie
i wish i really wish everyone could see this movie and if one single clip could make a difference i think the world would be a better place
overall its an uplifting movie but unfortunately it wont change the way most of the world think of this disability
siblings experiencing or who have lived with autism i think will see this movie differently
it does seem to preach to them how they should behave and what their responsibilities are
we parents siblings and autistic children are still waiting for the definitive movie that will open the world s eyes
this is about spain in the s with the falangists still in power
a salesman of dictionaries about the civil war is about to be fired
but his boss gives him another opportunity start making porno films together with your wife for my company they start doing so but there are conflicts of course
this movie can t decide if it is a comedy or a wannabe tragedy and it ends in neither
this could have been mostly funny if the creators had done more of the s feeling but they don t
and in the end you laugh more at the persons you ought to feel sorry about
not a must
mindblowingly gruesome and gory and thoroughly entertaining roller coaster ride takes the updated atmosphere of the remake and notches it even further in a prequel that effectively delineates the origin of leatherface and his cannibalistic family
r lee ermey returns as the sheriff we met in the remake realistically caring for his family in his own misguided and brutal way
especially of note in the cast is jordana brewster who beyond being devastatingly beautiful is really outstanding in the role of the major female heroine convincingly and movingly portraying the terror and the resilience of an innocent girl struggling to survive while confronted with unimaginable horrors and witnessing the brutality done to her closest friends
probably her best moment beyond the scene where she hides under the table as leatherface has his way with her boyfriend is the quiet moment where she stands at the door to the hewitt home staring at freedom inches away and then reluctantly does the right thing and turns to proceed haltingly upstairs to help her friend
and as her friend diora baird was also quite convincing and a dynamite screamer
the two young male leads were effective and likable and sympathetic in their own back story the effectswork is terrific yet not overdone fitting seamlessly into the storyline to visually tell the story of the horrors committed by this family and the film is very well supported by the music score of steve jablonsky who develops the atmospheric tonality developed for the remake and crafts a musical design that maintains a constancy of dread and a rhythmic panic inducing pulse during the action scenes
the main theme a horn melody intoned over a rhythmic underworking of fast moving violins really drives the film s excitement when it s not creating haunting tonalities during the suspenseful moments
jablonsky s reprisal of leatherface s theme is especially moving when he puts on the face of one of his victims wearing the human mask the leather face for the first time the score crescendos in a slow ascent of triumph yet tinged with the horror relevant in that triumph
john larroquette s narration at the end neatly tied into his opening monologue for the remake not to mention the original film as the latest take on the tcm franchise the film beyond being a terrific and not for the squeamish horror picture adds to the tcm mythology and illuminates the dementia behind america s most ghoulish family although it fails to provide an truly adequate psychological explanation or rationale to the events of the family s cannibalistic origin beyond suggestion that they were a survivalist reaction to circumstances
the beginning covers the events that started the family s rural rampage of murder real insight into what makes the family and the character tick wasn t really what this film was about
as a college instructor of modern problems and history i am appalled by the total lack of knowledge today s students and fellow instructors have regarding the issues surrounding wwii
moreover many of these same persons have no ability or desire to make the connection of those years as to how the world is now formulated
director dan curtis has exhibited both the will and ability to take both herman wouk s novel and incorporate it so successfully into this massive and titanic film
i believe that both wow and w r along with saving private ryan should be required film watching for all graduating high schoolers
admittedly many of the films realistic and gritty scenes are difficult to watch but unfortunately reality is often a cruel place
both wow and w r give an honest lesson on the eventual triumph of the forces of good over evil which the world faced in the middle of the th century
the side stories of the characters involved and their individual romances and escapades only solidify the historical significance of the film
my favorite scenes involved the accurate depiction of the battle of midway
midway probably saved several years of hard pacific fighting and thousands of lives as a result of the american victory
grade a performances for robert mitchum and jane seymore
steven berkoff was masterful as hitler and jeremy kemp continued his credible role as the sympathetic and loyal general armin von roon
barry morse also deserves credit for being able to switch roles from the slimy wolf stoller in wow to a wise but challenging general halder in w r one goof halder was not executed in the aftermath of the july attempt on hitler as depicted in the film he survived the war
both the winds of war and war and remembrance are films that must be seen
even if gregg araki didn t try so hard to be profound his movie would still be horrible
after hearing for the fourth time it s tempting to scream i get it
i ll acknowledge your irony if it will mean you ll stop beating me over the head with it araki s th rate script could have possibly been saved if he had at least hired th rate actors
rose mcgowan has about as much animation as a paper doll
it s almost painful to watch her act as if you want to finish her sentences for her to save her the trouble
i m still not convinced that james duval is an actor
i think he s some kind of mannequin brought to life by amateur puppeteers
johnathan schaech is the only saving grace in this festering pile of garbage
his talent was completely wasted
whomever gave gregg araki any kind of budget deserves to be shot
hard core criminals should be forced to read his writing as punishment
my sweet satan is a low budget short directed by and starring jim van bebber deadbeat at dawn
this outing has atrocious acting and is really only good for laughing at all the horrible haircuts on display the story is about a satan loving jerk off van bebber who kills one of his friends for stealing drug money from him
that s it
but i guess you re not gonna get too much plot in a minute film other than a few decent gore scenes which are really the only reason for watching this one my little satan is a dud
all of the characters are completely annoying and the satan side plot is stupid and unnecessary as it s never really explained or built on
give deadbeat at dawn a shot instead or hopefully you already got the synapse release of deadbeat at dawn and my little satan was on the extras only for the head stomp scene
i have just finished watching the complete series dvd collection of freaks and geeks one of the best high school television series on televisions that thanks to idiotic network executives who continue to make the decisions that make network television more and more unbearable to watch have truly missed out on a gem
and thanks to a healthy fan network i was able to enjoy every bit of the series as short as it was on dvd freaks and geeks was one of the most honest portrayals of high school life pleasantly departing from the overrated attention given to other television series and films who consistently focus on the untouchable classes of the dreaded high school social caste system that we are all likely too familiar with
the assorted teen dramas and the difficulty of just subsisting in the often passively rigid classes within the high school social scene
this television series presented things from two perspectives a group of freshman friends marked as the geeks and a group of older friends underachievers known as the freaks the geeks often provided the comical element to the show while the freaks often explore more dramatic story lines such as problems with parents a constant subplot self esteem drugs and more
although the geeks confronted their own share of problems their youth and easygoing attitude often made the situation more light hearted other commentators have often posited the question on the freaks and geeks board along with other short lived television series why shows like these never last long on television
while saved by the bell might have been the only show to be quite successful with it though only after significant retooling of the original series good morning mrs bliss would nbc even agree to pick up the show my guess is that this show may have initially had a difficult time finding a loyal audience in the crucial early days of the show
there were issues of drug use and teenage sex which some might not have found ideal for the younger viewers of this show people in their very early teens as this show tended to sometimes celebrate drug use even though there was one episode that was clearly anti drug
five years ago was a different time however
and shows like the o c on fox seems to get away with stories surrounding its young characters and attitudes towards casual sex
sadly however the network too is to blame as it shifted the show into unrecognizable time slots airing a show that was ideal for young audiences at a time when they would least likely be watching television friday and sunday evenings
i cannot say that this would be why other television series surrounding high school would also be canceled it might also be that the show was never given a fair chance
some might have quickly judged it as a rip off of the wonder years john daly and the geek gang especially neil and harris did look like characters you might find on that show not to mention the high school looking just like that in the wonder years my other guess for the reason that shows like these are often short lived is that they are too expensive to produce
freaks and geeks like my so called life filled a lengthy time slot of fifty minutes or so
filmed partially on location and partially on a set like sqaure pegs and my so called life a show like this becomes very expensive to produce and may unfortunately force some hasty decisions about how long a network would ride out slack ratings i still think nbc passed up a good thing and possibly other networks if it was pitched to them once being canceled
it was a great show that tried to produce a very dynamic set of characters and stories and did well i would also like to say while i adored nearly every character on the show except for nick who s obsession with lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre but a boring character i thought martin starr was the best as the witty bill haverchuck i love his bionic woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the halloween episode
though i thought him to be needlessly bizarre in the beginning particularly due to his gawky appearance he turned out to be one of the best characters
he always tried his best to be a good friend to everyone and he always had some of the funniest lines in th show joe flaherty as sam s dad also had a bunch of good one liners
and while he was not in the show but sporadically i also loved harris the geek mentor who always seemed so confident about everything long live freaks and geeks
may the television show s creators reconsider trying this one again even if you have to start over with a new cast since everyone has aged six years as of this writing
such a witty movie lot s of moments
clive owen a ronin sort of being has a baby actually the delivery scene is a hoot and he sets out to feed it and protect it
this is much better humor drama and better visuals than and yet in the same comic book style genre
but live it s exciting and very fast paced
but mainly tongue in cheek
great editing and direction the editing and film effects can throw you off at the start but hang in there it s worth it
once you get into the idiom you re hooked if you don t laugh you re dead see it
i helped make this movie
it was a very fun film for those interested in darker side of magic and the devil and what lusts life has to give to create the devil s child what things you could have happen if you really were in a cult who would save you
or would you fall to the evil within yourself
i feel truly inspired by david s work
he has a brilliant and dignifying diabolical ideas that really set your mind to thinking
i hope i can work with him again
i have many many more great ideas right now i m helping put together another film on magic and i m going to be in this one
if ya don t like the th angel then you never understood it in the st place
you never know maybe some of the movie has some truths in it maybe you ll get it after you see it a few more times syncerely th angel antichrist
escape from the brothel is one of those hongkong films that mix drama with action nudity and pure terror to make a notorious category iii classic
in a way it s also a love story but don t expect to get a hollywood standard happy end here a man falls in love with a prostitute who works in a brothel
he wants to get her out but there is no way to do that
the more he tries to help her the more violence he witnesses and he has to fight against it
in one scene he is attacked by a kick boxing nude amazon blonde sic
the second half of the film is a violent tour de force and as bodies are piling up during the action packed climax this film also becomes one of the goriest hongkong films aside the great the untold story and the viciously funny the ebola syndrome i recommend this film to everyone who likes category iii movies from hongkong
however people who are easily offended by the blending of sex and violence surely should let this one be
just an awesome movie with awesome special effects for
when watching remember it was not when it was made
the effects were years ahead of its day
worth every second to watch
now if they d only release it on dvd
i have foolishly viewed far too many of these films to die for dvd s from both the first go round the second
i think that perhaps lake dead is the nail in the coffin of my interest in these films
there were a few goodies in among the crap like reincarnation the abandoned and frontiers but as for the rest well utterly forgettable with little in the way of any redeeming values three girls inherit a hotel from their grandfather that they didn t know was alive
their father may well be a drunken fool but he at least tried to protect them from the knowledge of grandpa s existence
why
well because there were some unsavory family ties that he didn t want his daughter involved in and how unsavory were these ties
well grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film when he decides enough is enough apparently although a little late i d say
the girls of course head off to view their inheritance in a big rv that belongs to an old frat buddy of one of the daughter s boyfriends
also along for the ride is a friend of one of the daughters of the female persuasion
there is a bit of dismay expressed by the rv owner s girlfriend since her boyfriend has cheated on her numerous times and he s not done yet you can bet when they reach the hotel they re greeted by the shriveled manager a sweet old lady who really isn t all that sweet
and after tangling with some deformed looking locals they re picked up by the nice sheriff who really isn t so nice
and then it s sort of revealed that the girls may have a few family ties with these folks and they re due to keep the family line going i guess there s not a lot of good things that i can say about a movie where the highlight is a guy giving his mom some tongue i won t say who it is but if anything in this movie was scary that was it an abysmal piece of work not to be bothered with
out of
i was against film censorship and film ratings less than zero until i saw the aptly named five gates of hell as a previous critic noted a shabby little shocker
when asked to name a movie i wanted to unwatch this is at the top of my list
oh and just when you thought the sociopathic film couldn t be worse there s nancy kulp miss jane hathaway from the bev hillbillies with a hand grenade and neville brand in oriental blackface
if you re interested in the fates of women in world war ii and asian prisoner of war camps i suggest you watch the australian broadcasting corporation abc miniseries tenko
ichi is the prequel to ichi the killer
it s not the best movie in the world but it s a lot better than i thought it would be
it s about ichi in high school
he gets bullied and that s when he starts to go nuts
it s got some great fight scenes too
it s also of course got a few nasty scenes
the baseball scene was pretty disturbing
the main problem i had with this movie though was the fact that there were no teachers at the school
i can t believe not one teacher stopped any fights at school all those kids had
i didn t see one teacher at all at the school period
i guess all the kids scared them off or something
ichi is a low budget movie but much better than most low budget movie i ve seen
it s also got a bit of comedy in the movie too
the movie is all in japanese though so unless you can speak japanese you ll have to read the english subtitles
it s worth checking out if you liked ichi the killer but it might disappoint some people
i recommend renting it first i give ichi a
i do not understand why this movie is so often overlooked
it may not be a classic but it has it s moments
true sometimes the humor can be sophomoric even down right childish at times but there are the occasional jokes that an adult would to think about to understand
it has a goofy plot but is surprisingly well acted
it will not change your life in any way but it is pointless entertainment and for the most part non thought provoking fun
the problem with only you isn t so much that this low budget fare is structured upon ever romantic comedy clich you can think of
andrew mccarthy plays the misguided fool who is torn between the insincere bimbo kelly preston that he spends the christmas holiday at a tropical resort after being dumped and in a drunken haze travels there with his new companion
the clerk at the travel agency helen hunt who wouldn t give him a refund for his trip earlier in the evening coincidentally shows up there too on a freelance photography gig seriously these people must be traveling on supersonic rockets to get from chicago to the beachside resort so quickly
and of course the gold digging bimbo treats him like crap and he slowly starts to realize that perhaps the real girl for him is the genuine travel agent photographer he spends a lot of time with on his vacation when the bimbo is constantly hanging out somewhere with more manly men who swoon her
and yada yada yada the foolish protagonist must make up his mind about what kind of lady he wants and well it s not only typical to romantic comedy plots it s typical andrew mccarthy granted the movie does offer at least a few laughs but the movie would ve been much more believable had all of this not happened in the course of about ten days
true mccarthy s character was impulsive but it didn t seem to square that helen hunt s character was too
but of course this is a movie
and not even a really good one either
on the surface this tale of a brutal gang who rob a gas station hence the name
and take the workers hostage appears to be just another been there seen that asian thriller but underneath there s a soft centre waiting to be discovered short vignettes give us clues as to how these thugs came to be this way one of the hostages learns to stand up for himself characters who are even nastier than the robbers end up worst off and even the thugs themselves get a shot a redemption
ok it s not especially profound and like so many asian films it suffers from an inconsistency of tone lashings of violence swearing slapstick comedy and musical numbers make for a strange mix which might alienate some western viewers but it s fast moving never boring surprising in all the right places and a definite recommendation for a fun evening s viewing
saawariya isn t a perfect film actually nowhere near being perfect
but hey this movie isn t a trash either i was really stunned by the cinematography and the art direction of the movie it was beautiful many people say they were confused of what time period the story took place in
well this is a land of imagination a far far away land time period wasn t the crucial thing in the movie
yes the story is flawed i hated the ending anyways sakkena sonam kapoor wasn t really impressive she tried but she convinced me that she was crazy and thats the only reason why i liked the movie ranbir kappor is good not great but surely he will get better soon as for rani she is never bad sanjay leela bhansali made a beautiful looking movie not necessarily a great movie but if u watch it with it with open minds then maybe u will love it or lets say be able too see something more meaningful in the rather simple ending
the ending is a bit iffy and open ended i guess well thats the reason why i liked the movie though i bet sanjay leela bhansali dint intend the movie to imply so anyways i don t think of sanjay leela bhansali as a terrific director though khamoshi made me cry like hell and moreover he was the one who hired ash and salman in his superb film hum dil de who are both the worst actors india has ever seen anyways i hope sanjay leela bhasnsali gets a original script and some better actors to work on his next movie getting back to saawariya one thing that cant be denied is that this is a very important movie in the history of india many firsts in this movie
i hope people instead of criticizing learn some things from this movie and make more imaginative and beautiful films which indian cinema absolutely lacks
i m not a big fan of leslie howard but the petrified forest is his best film in my book he was great in the th parallel and of human bondage and he s great here too
in this film he is a lazy writer gone awry trying to live out his dreams in bette davis character who is a painter in a way he s totally opposite of humphrey bogart s duke mantee character and the dichotomy really is the justification of classic given to this film bogart s and davis performances are just average in this film although at the time of the release this was bogart s best film
i think the old man charley grapewin and genevieve tobin as mrs chisholm do a great job with their small parts
tobin is also a very attractive lady
i enjoyed the banter between the two drivers as well both african americans cast in a white movie at wb in
it s a shame they weren t given larger roles talky and melodramatic and certainly unbelievable the middle of nowhere desert gas station is almost always full of people for starters this stagy yet classic film is not for everyone
your kids will hate this film
but to me this is good stuff
this is prototypical s cinema
i was actually an extra in this film as the school scenes were filmed at my junior school st leonards church of england school in chelsham surrey
i remember having to wear my best school uniform and do as i was told
i was years old i suppose and it was all very exciting with the lights and the trailers and all the people buzzing around
i don t remember whether we were allowed to meet the stars i somehow doubt it this is a great film very atmospheric very spooky and totally believable kids in the s were obviously very resourceful and full of very odd ideas
needless to say i wasn t allowed to watch the film until i was much older than when i was in it
i ve seen my cousin vinny a thousand times and it always does the trick it entertains me to no end
i still laugh at the same scenes i laughed at when i first saw the film over fifteen years ago marisa tomei is flat out fantastic as mona lisa vito the wise cracking marriage wanting car fixing pizza chick who accompanies vinny joe pesci also brilliant to alabama in order to get his cousin ralph macchio and his friend mitchell whitfield off from murder charges when their car matches the suspect s car in a sac o suds homicide involving the clerk the comedic exchanges of pesci and fred gwynn the stuffy southern judge are gut busting
tomei and pesci on paper would appear to be the oddest coupling around but once you see the film you quickly become aware that their pairing is a casting triumph in short everyone pulls out all the stops to make this a movie you just can t get sick of no matter how many times you watch it i just saw it again last night
i personally would like to thank the academy for honoring tomei with a best supporting actress award for her performance
if you can find a more worthy recipient that year or any other for that matter i d like to know who you d come up with
story was relatively boring
directing was definitely boring
some of the dialogue was a little too predictable the one clever item was the deal with ritz and trying to figure out for a moment how someone found henry after he took off by himself
i won t write a spoiler
this movie is not worth the two hours spent on it
i must admit that i rather enjoyed this sherlock holmes fantasy story
nicholas rowe is in my mind the perfect holmes physically
his acting was also spot on perfectly capturing holmes enormous ego
the only negative about this story is that it falls back on some of the holmes film clich s
for example the bumbling dr watson which i think is an insult to the well written intelligent character of the novels
i d like to see watson used as something more than just comic relief
another bad clich is the action hero side of holmes
it doesn t work for his character i find
although it sometimes relies on the fact that the viewer hasn t read the novels and thus doesn t understand the real characters i loved this story
while a bit violent it perfectly captures the brilliant feel of the novels
what a massive desception this flick is a movie based around a plot as thick as ice is on a hot summer night is usually something you don t want to step on normally there would be some leverage before the layer breaks but beware step on this and you won t need a peddle you ll be swimming
you know those twilight zone episodes where you are instantly enraptured into the plot and then at the end there is a surprise twist and all of a sudden the episode come across differently
and you are shocked and awed by what happens well i think the makers of this movie were going for this but instead decided to fire the writer halfway thru and get someone else entirely that could bandage the rest of the plot and jam the contents of their script in with the previous writers story
it reeks of it
the ending is one of the worst i ve ever seen
spoiler it says hey look we took this amount of time to tell this story and since we have no resolution whatsoever with the characters or the story we are just going to kill the lead off
wtf
it is extremely sloppy and it completely leaves entire script holes that without resolution or at least acknowledgment become script sinkholes
like for instance why is the dad shown in the photos at the end the doctor at the beginning
why does the blackmailing girlfriend have a wound that is freshly bleeding in from a wound that happened in in the alternate reality
spoiler arghhhh this is just a frustrating movie in which you think the lead is just psychotic then you learn no it s really you you are the crazy one who bothered to see this ryan phillipe movie
i want my minutes back
joan crawford returned to mgm for torch song after a decade of other films at other studios in a role that paints her character as tough as nails in fact so tough that you expect her to take out a gun at any moment and shoot anyone who disagrees with her bossy persona
not only is she tough but the script is trite from beginning to end and the whole film is garishly lit in bright technicolor to show off joan s wardrobe and a neat pair of legs
it all seems like a warm up for johnny guitar in lush settings rather than a saloon that she can t sing is obvious because it s immediately apparent that a professional singer is doing the songs india adams
and despite her early days as a hoofer doing the charleston and other dances during her flaming youth it s also easy to see that dancing is not her strong point
so she seizes the bitchy role of a dame who treats a blind pianist with such scorn that even his dog growls every time she comes near him an appalling blackface number is enough to gag on using a leftover track from a cyd charisse film that never made the final cut and her confrontations with michael wilding the blind pianist gig young a drunken playboy what else
harry morgan a stage manager agent and marjorie rambeau as her plain speaking mother are all strictly theatrical harsh and unconvincing one thing i ll say she does haughty and overbearing so well that it s hard to remember that in real life she was so afraid of further humiliation by the cast and crew of hush hush sweet charlotte that she left the film and feigned illness to get out of playing the role of cousin miriam
she also pleaded illness when she was afraid to attend the academy awards afraid she might lose but put her make up on for the cameras when the radio announcement came that she won nobody looks good in this one but speaking of academy awards marjorie rambeau got nominated for her mother role here
she s not bad but it must have been a dreary year for best supporting actresses this one belongs near the bottom of joan s career and surely any sane person would want to miss it leaving it entirely to crawford s ardent die hard fans who think this is high camp particularly unbelievable and jarring is the ending which has crawford and wilding realizing that they love each other after all the harsh words and deeds are over
total rubbish
this is a movie directed at young children i watched it with my little brother who will eat up the slapstick and inept adults
if you have seen the first contemporary version starring mason gamble don t see this
justin cooper liar liar and home alone in not even half as good as was gamble in the first this movie would be totally worthless if not for the cinematography of christopher faloona
he uses strange camera angles lots of overhead shots and employs some cool tricks with the focus
this is the only thing that kept me from rating this movie a my grade
as a comic book fan you know what
forget as a comic book fan
as a person who enjoys watching television this thing is absolutely ridiculous
seriously this is implausible to a person who has spent their entire life being raised on television and comic books let s start out with costume talk
these things look like costumes my mother made for my brother and me when we were twelve and eight and wanted to be dc superheroes technically he was a villain but slade wilson was always such a cool character you know
what is that thing that the atom is wearing
it s like the costume designer just said how much styrofoam can i fit into this costume
i need more and what s up with putting green paint under fire s eyes
it just looked stupid the writing is god awful
let me get this straight on the whole i m not fire thing
leaving alone the fact that this woman looks exactly the same in and out of costume in front of the martin guy there s just the fact that when she s rejecting him she s still wearing his earrings
this just threw me for a loop man
if a guy gets you a present telling you he spent a ton of money on it and then you reject him
you give the present back
especially if you re rejecting him within a minute of getting the present
the earrings thing should never have been a problem cause the fact that she was wearing the earrings was ridiculous plus i love that ending man
everything winds up happy right
barry gets a job lantern gets his girl back martin gets a girlfriend and ice and atom seem to have a beautiful relationship starting
plus there s the last shot of the league walking forward each of them moving so stiffly that i think it might be a group superpower and don t get me started on the j onn j onzz thing
i know that david ogden stiers is a good actor and i don t mean to be a purist or anything but when i think about words to describe the martian manhunter obese doesn t come to mind i watched this movie for free and for shear camp value and maybe a laugh it s good for about half an hour
not the first half hour that s the slowest damn beginning i ve ever seen
but a half hour somewhere in the middle if you re really bored watch it on you tube
but if you like the justice league you should be willing to watch cartoons
just go for jlu and enjoy yourself for minutes
joe gould comes across as an annoying and irritating character unfortunately the character has no warmth to it
instead it grates on the viewer the movie started ok but as the gould character came into itself its shenanigans became too much to bear
the incessant bickering the tantrums the mood swings were just too much
at one point the character was vandalizing a phone booth and it was just not believable that the barkeeper did not kick his ass out of the establishment also highly irritating is the fake accent employed by stanley tucci for his mitchell character
for some reason it just doesn t work all in all i pretty much hated this movie and could not wait for it to end
some movies are not great but are serviceable
after about minutes the gould character makes this movie completely unwatchable todd
based on a broadway play another language is one of those gems from yesteryear that few have heard of
it has much to recommend it chiefly believable and detailed interaction among members of a rather large and unpleasant family mostly given to self absorption but with moments of genuine compassion and caring that surface unexpectedly
one of the members of this family is margaret hamilton who was in the broadway original in one of the few roles that allowed her to enact a somewhat complex human being
louise closser hale is perfectly cast as the controlling selfish mother who sets the tone for her whole brood
helen hayes a supremely skilled actress who could play ordinary people and make them fascinating wins the viewer over completely as the bride who runs afoul of her in laws
i wanted to marry her myself
the standout however is young john beal who delivers a passionate performance as robert montgomery s younger brother
possible spoiler follows his character is introduced well after the conflict between hayes and the family is established
he is appalled that his family is treating hayes so shabbily and falls madly dangerously recklessly in love with her
his vital fresh faced youthful innocence and earnestness captivate the viewer
he too had played the same role in the stage version
this performance might have launched beal to the top of the hollywood firmament but hollywood didn t suit him and he settled into a year career of minor films regional theater and numerous tv roles
montgomery himself is top notch as usual playing the insensitive product of his narrow minded mother s upbringing
don t let the conventional opening scene as hayes and montgomery disembark from their honeymoon cruise fool you
it gets better fast
the theme is similar to that of holiday based on a philip barry play in which a free spirited outsider clashes with members of his fianc e s stodgy traditional banking family
although not cinematically daring in any way another language delivers the emotional goods
don t know what all the hype was about
all in all i cried about wasting my time watching this over hyped film
did absolutely nothing for me as for the big surprise it certainly was not a secret to me
it was telegraphed way ahead of time so that my reaction at the fateful moment was is that all there is
i actually kept watching the rest of the movie since i was expecting something bigger or more shocking nothing at all special about this movie
firstly some reviewer has claimed the events of the movie are dated to
it is wrong
by that time diderot was already dead
the year appears in the beginning of the movie as a date of french revolution to which diderot was a kind of forerunner
the right dating seems to be s when diderot should have been about his as it comes also from his daughter age and from boucher s painting which the company views during the sideshow in the end of the movie
this painting was executed in about
now despite all these historical correspondences the viewer must understand this movie is not about diderot s real life it is a fantasy which includes personage named denis diderot who in some instances has some common features with historical person denis diderot
now when you come to see the movie try to forget all you know if you do about the real diderot and just enjoy the jokes the funny situations and delightful absurdities of the movie
if you ll do this you will really love the film
to some sever judges i would suggest reading rabelais
humor is a special genre with its special rules and demands and most important with a lot of very diverse faces
you can not evaluate it departing from your personal ideology philosophy or whatever you should concern it in its own terms and believe me such are exist
le libertin is a light and wonderfully filmed comedy
it leaves you with a kind smile on your lips when the last frame makes its place to titles and a strong wish to watch it again immediately
the cast is incredible especially fanny ardant who as she always do manages to create truly complex personage
nudity is natural not hidden not shaming in a painful contrast with puritan hollywood
the same is true regarding the matters of sexuality
gabriel aghion made a good job and thanks to le libertin p dale douce and belle maman i am ready to forget his disastrous p dale dure
really recommended to anyone who is ready to open his mind to things that may be not exactly of his style
some of the comments left by people on here show just how clueless movie goers can be
as if you can t tell that there s a slight tongue in cheek feel to the movie
doesn t the stupidly high kill count or ott methods used to kill people make that obvious to you
does a movie with the title shoot em up sound like a serious piece of work
come on some of you just need to relax and use your brains a little i haven t much to say on the movie itself since its ones of those entertained me but probably won t buy the dvd films i so often see in cinemas
acting was good action was good plot was ok go see it
if you love it great if you don t oh well
it really is one of those kind of movies
just remember not expect a serious film reminiscent of james bond or die hard ok
the whole reason i picked up this movie in the first place is that i just adore low budget made horror movies because in my opinion they normally turn out to be better than the big budget horror films examples campfire tales and dead end
this movie just gives all low budget films a bad name
many people before me have talked about how horrible it is but it was just so bad i can t resist to write about it where do i even begin
the acting
wow
just plain out horrible
even jamie lynn s performance made me sick and from what i hear she s supposed to be good
but just wow
i am just blown about how horrible it was
then there s the special effects my saying is if its not good don t even bother with them
i mean the background of a full moon in the second story didn t even look real at all
next the cameras
whatever type of cameras they used just made the movie worse
it looked like i was watching a documentary at times because it was so horrible the plot line wasn t even that good
the only story that even made me a little creeped out was the third one
thats only cause i put myself in the girl s position
and even that one had a thousand plot holes
basically what i m trying to say is that if you like watching horrible acting filmed with horrible cameras with horrible effects about a horrible plot line this is will be your new favorite movie
looking at this movie i wondered if i did not already see it
the theme is not original anymore we have seen the setting in other movies the acting is poor as is the story
so there is no reason why i should recommend this movie to anybody
this movie love from a stranger is based on a story written by agatha christie
it is similar to love from a stranger made in black and white in starring basil rathbone and ann harding this one is from black and white
the stars of this movie are john hodiak as manuel cortez and sylvia sidney as cecily harrington the premise is the same in both movies
a woman wins a sweepstakes lottery drops her boyfriend and meets mr wonderful who sweet talks her marries her in a short time and prepares to kill her at sometime in the near future at pm cecily is the target
she finds out more about manuel her husband while he is away one night and gets scared
she sees a hole like a burial hole down in the cellar where no one is allowed to go
i like the ending in this one too is was like a bar fight but much better
the one with basil rathbone had a ironic ending too
you can watch this with john hodiak on this imdb site which will link you to hulu
you can download the one with basil rathbone at archive org for free or watch it on line with the same name

ah yes slavoj zizek a man who is a household name but only in his own household
apparently he s the most famous slovenian in the world which is surprising since i ve never heard of him and i have heard of milan kucan
perhaps the hype should have said most famous slovenian to have appeared in a minute documentary by astra taylor
from what i ve learned from this documentary all you have to do in order to be credited as a philosopher is point out something no one has noticed before as in fascists don t clap while stalinists clap themselves hey zizek might actually have a point until you watch an edition of family fortunes
it might actually be that people who clap themselves are educationally subnormal rather than believers in one country socialist democide the second point about being a philosopher is being able to state the painfully obvious as in the more coke you drink the more thirsty you feel therefore the more coke you will drink the thirstier you will become to be fair to zizek he does point out out that there is decaffeinated coke but no one spends a great deal of time and money drinking decaf we drink coke because caffeine is an addictive drink and thirst has nothing to do with it
if i point out that the apple of knowledge is a euphemism for drug addiction does that make me one of the world s greatest living philosophers
there is some unintentional amusement to zizek like for example he describes a child watching television as narcissistic amusement wtf

and he lies in bed waxing lyrically about the human condition
yeah that s right he cannot go to bed without having his great thoughts recorded for posterity
in fact mr zizek comes across as one of those people who if he were discussing films shouts down everyone else s opinions because the lighting makes san francisco look like los angeles so that s not the golden gate bridge in the background you can t disagree with his arguments because you re not sure what he s talking about and as a footnote mr zizek apparently makes a considerable living on touring seminars
it might be a good idea to watch zizek before you pay money to attend one of his classes because i m sure you ll here the same things said down the pub
i m a huge fan of jack lemmon
i loved him in the apartment and the odd couple
out of towners is a timeless classic comedy in my opinion
i mean come on
jack lemmon in a neil simon story
how can you go wrong with that
there are alot of funny lines that jack lemmon uses that makes the movie what it is
i couldn t imagine anyone else playing the role of george kellerman
this movie is a definte classic comedy that will never be forgotten
robert crumb is not everybody s cup of tea
he has been accused of being a racist and a misogynist
this film does much to deal with misconceptions about the artist but not all the misconceptions are negative as typical for a documentary like this there are several artists critics interviewed about crumb s work
invariably there is some sort of analysis given
crumb s compared to brueghel to daumier he s spoken of as a great political satirist the fact is the first thing discussed in the film is what motivates crumb s art what is he trying to express
after a slightly amused slightly annoyed jesus
i dunno he speaks that he doesn t think of his work in conscious terms until after he s drawn it then he figures out what it s about this film very subtly points out crumb is not really anything he s been accused or praised for being
his work is the purest form of his id his wife aline comments the film is really his triumph to be himself through a number of horrendous hurdles a brutal father and drug addicted brother being rejected by women being tempted to sell out and legal problems over cartoons
while his two brothers charles and max both show in differing degrees how their youths were permanently scarred then robert crumb emerges whole even admirable in spite of the uncompromising nature of his art
he is unique his work not easily separable into allegorical meanings or expression of political beliefs crumb is a great artist and he cannot be understood from a few interviews and his art can t reduced into something understandable in clich d artistic terms
zwigoff s film shows crumb in every way available and tries to express his art similarly
at the end all we can do is be astonished that the man not only survived but flourished and marvel at the wide range of what he s produced zwigoff s style is so seamless it doesn t feel like his film but crumb s
of course it is not crumb s but that impression is an indication of zwigoff s mastery of the form
if his own personality intrudes in the fabric of the film by what he shows and how he orders it he complements rather than obscures crumb s genius the result is unforgettable not just for its exposition of crumb artist and human being but for the experience of letting zwigoff s work flow over the film and us
oh my god what rubbish some people say about some crap filmsthe film is a remake of angels with a dirty faces and is so bad it makes you cringesrk plays a bachchan type of goon role and tries hard but his weird voice and his utterances at every sentence gets to the nervesthe goons to even the cop are cartoonsthe film shows ram jaane as a big hero praised by bhasti vale like bachchan in agneepath sarkarrajiv verma direction is bad music is okaysrk as said before tries hard but his weird voice and also expressions at places are a give away juhi is okay vivek mushran is okay the rest ham even the talented pankuj kapoor
jerry seinfeld is one of the funniest stand up comedians out there today
sure he may not be a saint buying a whole building just for his cars but we do need to cut him some slack as he provided millions of people with millions of laughs for a long time
i saw i m telling you for the last time before i actually got into the series itself i was young when it first aired and so now i am feasting off reruns
the fact that i had not seen nearly every seinfeld episode which now i have see most of made this bit of stand up even funnier as i had never heard most jokes before
but still it aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it it was still very funny
definitely recommended to all seinfeld fans and i believe that many others will also be entertained
if you liked this and the seinfeld series i would also recommend jerry seinfeld s book seinlanguage
of course it s much funnier when you can can see and hear him tell the jokes and so if this ever comes on tv again you can bet i ll be taping it
the italian people probably felt a moral degradation knowing that their government had participated in exterminating jews during wwii
the garden of the finzi continis was probably their way of showing that they were atoning for it
it tells of the jewish finzi contini family in ferrara in the s
they are a very well off family with a false sense of security and many of the people within the family are falling for each other
unfortunately for them not even their social status can protect them from the doom that awaits them much like in the bicycle thief over years earlier vittorio de sica shows the desperate existences of a few people surrounded by what many incorrectly assumed to be a joyful world
wonderful
as much as i hate to say it saawariya did disappoint me
it had everything new stars lovely songs a magical and enchanting set but it lacked soul there are many whys and hows raised in certain parts of this film and for the purpose of those reading i shall not include any spoilers within my review but if we look away from these things then all in all saawariya is an average movie
if anything is going to bring this movie forward it will be ranbir kapoors acting
he is simply superb you almost see shades of raj kapoor kicking in at times which my mum was very happy about
and of course shades of his own dad rishi which was excellent ranbir kapoor is truly an absolute gem in this movie and i felt that if he wasn t in the frame that something was missing thats the impact he made on me
he s innocent eyes and charming persona really will make a few hearts flutter
sonam kapoor is again a good actress although i don t think we really got the chance to see what we she made of as her character didn t really have much to do but from what we see things are promising salman khan was quite wasted in the movie he is looking older and bigger but nevertheless i will still remain a fan of his rani mukerjee i feel does bring some life into the otherwise dull blue surroundings especially in her song
she has done well in her short but important role all in all although saawariya fails to meet our expectations from a great director like bhansali it still has that pulling factor i feel to make it do well at the box office go watch it for ranbir kapoor he deserves it
lies is a story of two people who have a sexual obsession
that is the whole plot in a nutshell
they don t come together for any other reason than to have all out straight up kinky beat each other up sex and they re not pretending there is any other reason
they glory in it they obsess about it they talk about their last encounter and look forward to the next one
the best thing about it is the way it draws you in and makes you watch just to find out where will all this end
to all the reviewers who complained about the grapehic sex so why did you watch it
you can t see five minutes of this movie without getting the idea so what were you doing
tied to your chair maybe
couldn t get free to turn it off
held at gunpoint
what a bunch of hypocritical goober heads neither of the protagonists is particularly attractive not in the conventional way and i didn t feel that anything was shown for pornographic purposes although that would have been ok with me
it is simply an account of an intense sexual relationship where the whole reason for being together is kinky sex and this idea is followed through the film
you may not have any sympathy with the characters or like them or even be able to empathize at all but you have to watch because you just know it is going to get more intense and it does each time j and y come together the sex gets more intense more brutal kinkier and nastier
they beat each other unmercifully finding ever more severe objects to whale on each other with
sounds kinda fun doesn t it
the intent though is to show such a relationship and show how it develops where it can go and how it could happen
it even goes one better by making j an older man an artist who is very class sensitive and somewhat tormented
y is a schoolgirl and her motives are never completely clear as they probably wouldn t be to someone her age in this relationship i would never have watched this except for the reviews complaining about the graphic sex and violence
that got my interest quick but then i was sucked in by the plot
i just had to know where this was going and predicted some big blow up at the end
i thought that possibly one would kill the other during a beating or their families would intervene
either way i had to know what happened and that to me is the best part of this movie
first of all alex sanger and karen craig should be loathed and possibly incarcerated for ever writing this
in fact everyone involved here deserves a if not physical then atleast a verbal lash or two the plotline mila kunis yes that s girl plays rachel newman who thanks to the fact that the writers who obviously never quite understood the original flick as a child witnesses the final murder of serial killer patrick bateman
after growing up she attends the fbi academy for serial killer profiling
however it soon becomes clear that she is quite the psycho herself and starts to hack n slash her classmates that seems to pose a threat to her
very soon it s just a brainless teen slasher and not even as a teen slasher is it worthy of your time however little your time may be worth
fast forward there are not many highlights in this movie at all
if you have seen american psycho do not under any circumstances watch this the flagrant script is enough to eject this straight to video release
i don t think that the original screen adaption surpassed the book in quality but for this sequel the term art pollution comes in handy
heavens no
this film is actually better than it is being credited for
it s number one strength is definitely the skill of lucy lawless although it s somewhat wasted in many emotionally light scenes and the script can at times be slightly inept
however it s an interesting story with something to say
introducing some very thought provoking themes and ideas about the boundaries of science and human power it shows a rather creative way in which nature can punish us for our own idiocy
a surprising bonus is the high quality of special effects involved
there s really nothing that comes off as fake
campy maybe but not fake
in the end this film is satisfying
especially when compared to the vast sea of other made for tv movies it stands out ahead of the pack
it s sequel vampire bats while still far from perfect draws on this film s strengths and builds upon them
both movies are worth a watch and worth owning if you are a fan of lucy
i saw the road home more than a year ago and the film its themes and its content have stayed with me
this movie moved me deeply and there are times i still think of it fondly
it had moments of intense humor and moments of deep sadness
the emotional roller coaster this movie put me on was one very few films can achieve let alone sustain throughout the length of the movie
the road home is a movie that should be seen by masses
it is an exceptional film one that deserves to be shown to the public at large
drew johnson has the markings of a major league film maker and with this movie he hits one out of the park
futuristic films production and terry lofton give us this extremely low budget movie that should be avoided at all cost it s a complete waste of time no matter if you re looking for a horror movie or a comedy this doesn t fit in any category i ve seen better kindergarten plays
the nails are clearly made of rubber the special effects are cheap sauce used as blood etc
the acting you can t really call it acting but anyhow it s non existent not one single line of text is said in a natural convincing way
the killers synthesizer voice is annoying and what s with the helmet the director wants us to think that the killer is the girl that was raped in the beginning of the movie it would make sense if it was when you look at the body of the killer it pretty much matches the body of the girl but then turns out that when they remove the helmet we find out that the killer is the girls father
not likely he s taller and larger i m guessing in an attempt for a final twist they just decided to make him the killer
a firm favourite of mine during my nursery school years button moon had a large following of fans in those who were tots in the early eighties
it was a very low budget show with the characters were put together using wooden spoons and tin cans but it worked when complimented with simple story telling and a solid musical score there was something very surreal about button moon that i loved as a child although i could see why people now link it to a drugs trip
but it was a show that proves you don t need high quality cgi to keep small children and adults
entertained
upon viewing it recently after a friend bought the dvd it certainly brought back memories and would no doubt be equally as popular with today s toddlers as it was with kids in the eighties
this movie has to be seen to be believed
it fails miserably on every level
fortunately joe brooks handled the direction writing and lead acting role himself so there are fewer people to blame for it as a romantic lead joe has about as much appeal as a potted plant
his leading lady shelley hack acts as though she were posing for the picture on front of a box of all bran
it s pretty bad when the most professional acting performance in a movie is delivered by a little girl danielle brisebois joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician even though all of his serious songs still sound like extended jingles and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra
watching his dramatic gestures as he conducts this ear splitting opus in the recording studio as the dazzled shelley hack grins at him like a stuffed loon is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes ever filmed joe was obviously hoping for another big chart topper like you light up my life but its inexplicable success was not to be matched by the cringe inducing dirge that is this film s theme song
i don t know who performed it but he doesn t sing it as much as he suffers through it
he seems to be battling his way through a particularly intense bout of constipation as he strains to expel the stomach churning lyrics
but i doubt if even debby boone could ve made this song any more tolerable when i saw this movie on hbo several years ago i just had to have it
i watch my tape every so often just to gape in wide eyed amazement at how truly awful a movie can be
as a bad movie lover i hold this perversely entertaining cinematic messterpiece in high esteem it s the plan from outer space of romantic movies and truly one of the worst films ever made
cigarettes is a bad movie no doubt
but bad movies can be interesting sometimes even addicting to watch
for me and the small group of people who watched it with me a couple of nights ago it was a struggle to avoid hitting the stop button halfway through it this movie was just horrible
the characters were not likable or interesting all whining and repetitive
the many intertwined stories seem like they came out of some stupid wb show only to be painfully stitched together at the end to give it all some phony full circle effect
this movie is just fluff the enemy of substance
there is nothing here hasn t been done before a thousand times in many better films i wish i could find one redeemable moment one glistening quote one interesting subplot but there was literally nothing at all
just an awful movie that wasn t even worth the rental price
i came away from dead man s shoes with a sense of pride a sense of acknowledgment a feeling that british film at its lowest budget level and at its grittiest and simplest is very much alive and active
the reaction i had also affected the way i perceive hollywood a little bit more it s true that films like zodiac blood diamond and apocalypto occupy my top three of but even some of them and the many others on that list do not match the fondness and recognition that i had for dead man s shoes upon seeing it the great thing is this was extensively levelled down in terms of funding but pumped up in terms of quality
make no mistake dead man s shoes is very good i suppose in order to identify this film i d have to borrow from america somewhat but that is no shame this film is s rain man meets a hard as nails gritty revenge film perhaps something staring james cagney in his pomp
but it is a revenge film with an air of indifference the film is often funny often touching and often heart warming in its portrayal of inept small time crooks its nasty flashbacks of bullying and its small inclusion of scenes in which someone with special needs is present and displaying his innocence
while i have only seen the rather underwhelming once upon a time in the midlands from director shane meadows this isn t so much as a jolt back in the right direction as it is a full blown shove back onto the correct tracks
meadows directs and unfolds his story in a brilliant manner but in a manner that utilises so many techniques that we the audience flip from happy to sad to anger to disgust and in such a way that we have time to appreciate what we re seeing feeling and what we think of it all paddy considine plays richard a soldier fresh back from what i can only assume to be the horrors of iraq and the iraq war going on
but where road side bombs and ambushes have been erased richard is psychologically stuck with constant explosions going off in his mind anger rage sadness and that lust for revenge when he learns his younger more simple brother has suffered torment and bullying at the hands of the local drug dealers and young adults who have not matured enough to shake off that chav mentality
needless to say he brings home the horrors of iraq with him in all their bloody infamy in what could be one of the best post war syndrome studies since travis bickle in taxi driver
the film poster of said film on someone s flat wall perhaps hints at this but apart from the horror and the tragedy which does grab you thanks to some flashbacks that i eventually came to fear popping up everything is revealed in a satisfying and balanced way
initially the users of the boy call him over and tap him on the back and invite him in and everything seems very harmless we even think he is close enough to these people to go out and get some groceries for them if nothing else is on
but whatever we thought is quickly presented to us over and over in a frankly quite brilliant piece of directing and pacing as we realise these people are not what they are cracked up to be
further utilisation of the kid follows then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play
meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film indeed when you see herbie wolfenden trundle down the road in his citroen cv with the other guys in the back you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels at how these people are presented as people who live breath hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars but then again you get the feeling of disturbance
we are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking
meadows also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something
richard s initial work that he carries out on the gang all feels as if it builds up to the big showdown with the final gang member the one member we will feel a juxtaposition toward since he has a wife and two children
onto the wrongdoers in question initially herbie is introduced but then we get two of his lackey accomplices living in an apartment onto a further pair of heavies that come over and finally sonny stretch who is the chief antagonist in the bullying of the brother to him it goes beyond a joke it turns into an actual hatred a hatred of those with special needs with elements of fascism towards those who are not normal starting to creep into the film and its character s psyche so this is meadows introducing to us the villains in stages the targets richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge we are systematically told what richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of richard showing up now and again with scare tactics
but with a hero on a mission and a twist that packs a punch dead man s shoes is a big success
when he confronts the family man at the end richard himself says that he is now the monster which tells us that we do not have to root for him any more if we don t want to as he is confronting an apparent innocent but the film is brilliant in its build up its finale and its attention to detail great stuff
honest scathing look at alternative cartoonist and his family
his relationship with his brothers charles maxon and the genesis and motivation for his art are well captured by director zwighoff
sometimes disturbing but always entertaining crumb represents one of the best documentaries of the s
few know that this film was the studio s biggest blockbuster until jaws was released years later
the film does chronicle some of the exploits of audie murphy who having grown up dirt poor in texas went on to become the most highly decorated soldier of wwii
the film is somewhat dated and was definitely cleaned up to appeal to a larger audience but nonetheless it gives a pretty accurate version of this man s damn near suicidal bravery
because murphy was rejected by the marine corps and was a fairly small man in stature an under current of the underdog story develops as the young murphy attempts to do just about anything in order to improve himself
this was not murphy s first film so perhaps this explains his above average performance and seeming comfort on camera
he is supported by a crew of veteran performers marshall thompson jack kelly who do there best to let murphy be the center of attention
it s a terrific story enhanced only a little by the fact it s true and if you re able to imagine a remake of this film i don t see how it couldn t be successful
i have not seen this picture and probably never will
i am disappointed that richard tyson is unable to be cast in a decent movie
i feel he has the chops and when younger was a sexy bad boy actor
i hope as he has matured he will be offered rolls as a mature romantic lead or second banana
that i would go see the other members of the cast are mostly unknown to me
i admit to being an older woman but do enjoy movies that have a realistic story line good actors and well written dialog
the teen crowd isn t the only demographic that enjoys a good thriller but not the crud they produce now a days
lets put our brains to work and come up with some good stories for the viewing audience
the first thing that needs to be said about this movie is something that should and shall be said about all reb brown movies
reb brown runs like a girl
there i am glad i have got that out of the way
this is something that is apparent from the word go in this movie
yor dramatically enters and proceeds to skip across the desert arm flailing about and generally he is looking like he has never ran across rough terrain before
i sure this wasn t the intention
i m sure that the intention was for yor to come across as quite adept and at home in this barren landscape
equipped with nothing more than an axe a loincloth and a fantastic theme tune i sure he was supposed to appear to be some kind of natural hunter at one with his surroundings and senses
but unfortunately as i have said before reb brown runs like a girl that said everybody should be like yor
everybody should have their own them tune
a theme tune that not only can inspire you to achieve great things in your life but can also inspire those around you to become better people and put their absolute trust in you
yor s theme tune is great
it does all that a personal theme tune should do
it spontaneously burst into play whenever he does something slightly random like killing a giant bat and using it as a hang glider or performing fantastic trapeze stunts with an ageing fat caveman who has man boobs
but more about those incidents later yor is a hunter
quite what he hunts is a mystery to me
with this movie apparently set in pre historic times surely everybody is a hunter therefore making the term hunter meaningless
nonetheless yor is a hunter
in this his first and only movie he quickly befriends the saggy old man pac and a very clean cave woman called kala
together they travel through prehistoric lands accidentally destroying every single tribe village or civillisation that they happen to come across
i mean all
sorry to give that one away but seriously
yor is the cause of the destruction of no less than five tribes of people
sometimes intensional sometimes purely by accident
he is one of those people that you really would try your best to divert from your village
he is however quite adept at killing mutated paper mache dinosaurs
i say mutated because they are quite simply like no dinosaurs i have ever seen and react like no creatures i have ever heard of
the first being a cross between a stegosaurus and a triceretops a tristegoceretops if you will
but after killing it he does what every hunter would do drinks it s blood but as he so wisely puts it drinking the blood of your enemy makes you stronger
then there is the giant bat
the most useful creature in his entire world
not only does it fly past at just the right time but this creature conveniently goes into instant rigour mortis even before it hits the ground
this allows yor to use the said bat as a hang glider to fly into a cave rescue kala and you guessed it entirely wipe out the tribe that kidnapped her
fantastic stuff this is a very interesting world it has to be said there are a few things that can be learnt from this movie
the first being you can make absolutely anything out of straw
straw seems to be the most versatile substance in the entire world
pac s bow and arrows are made from it villages are entirely made from it they even sail a boat made from straw
which bring me to my next learning point if you are planning to sail to a place called the island of storms don t do it in a straw boat
that really is just asking for trouble but it is at the island of storms that the movie takes an unexpected twist at least it would be if the blurb on the back of the video box din t tell you the entire plot of the movie
the movie gets invaded by a completely different movie altogether
but not just any movie it gets invaded by a cheap remake of star wars
led by the overlord who is a dead ringer for the emperor and his team of robots who are dead ringers for darth vader they capture yor and demand to take over the movie
despite futile efforts to resist yor is eventually forced to submit to there demands and pick up his blaster rifle to continue the battle
something which he learns to use confidently in a very short space of time
it is a skill he uses efficiently in his other movie space mutiny where he also runs like a girl screams like a girl and generally acts all girlie like
joe dante s the howling is a classic werewolf movie with some good effects and i loved it but it wasn t close to the novel and they even said so
it s still a good film
so when clive turner decided to do a third howling sequel he decided to make it closer to the novel which was fine howling iv is about a writer named marie who after having a metal breakdown goes to a town called drago with her husband richard
once there marie begins to hear howling noises from outside her husband think s she s making it all up due to her breakdown and the townsfolk are not too concerned about the noises
soon an ex nun arrives and tells marie about a friend of her s that was attacked in drago and marie has seen her in her mind
the two soon go off searching for info about the town s history her husband soon catches an eye on the art owner who resembles a similar look to marsha from the howling
after meeting her again in the woods she changes into a werewolf and bites
after telling marie it was a wolf that attacked him the next day he tells her he fell and scratched is shoulder soon her nun friend discovers that the town people are werewolves and hurries to warn marie meanwhile marie s publisher tom also tries to warn marie but sees richard in the road thriving in pain
he tries to help him only to get killed by a werewolf in the bushes
it s not long before marie and the ex nun hide in the bell tower where marie must wait outside while she summons the werewolves with the bell doing so marie has no choice but to burn the tower with her friend and after looking at the burnt body of her husband a werewolf jumps out at her although i haven t read the novels reading the reviews and seeing the film gives me a clue what the novel is like
howling iv isn t a bad film the transformation is kind of good and the werewolf in the tower isn t that bad
the one thing is that the werewolves don t show themselves until the final twenty minutes of the movie but i wasn t that bothered
i enjoyed the film i also love that theme song something evil something dangerous
ok first off nell s lakeside idyll is a tva lake made for generating hydroelectric power in the s
so much for untouched by civilization
and where d they come up with the idea that twentieth century mountain people practiced these crude bronze age cave burials
bogus and manipulative all the way through it s a patronizing rip off even without its condescending and wholly fraudulent ideas about appalachian history
jodie foster tries desperately to gimp her way to an academy award and surprisingly it didn t work unlike dustin hoffman s one note performance in rain man or al pacino s self parody in scent of a woman
michael apted should know better having done a half decent job portraying mountain life in coal miner s daughter
an altogether horrible film the worse for its pretensions and delivering some profound truths
having always loved his knockout performance as the egoticstical producer in the band wagon and being familiar with his recordings i watched this latterday jack buchanan movie with great expectation
a parody of the johnny ray type celebrity it s based on a long running stage show that also starred buchanan
the idea itself isn t bad and with the right handling it could ve been a british equivelent of the girl can t help it it even features britain s own blond bombshell diana dors in a cameo but the satire is limp and j lee thompson is far more at home in gritty thrillers than froth like this
what we end up with is a silly in the annoying sense witless piece typical of the mediocre stuff rank was churning out in the s the film is dominated by constant mugging and bad performances the teeth grindingly unfunny psychiatrist rates special mention clumsy slapstick joan sims repeatedly swooning whenever she sees the singer buchanan falling into a fish pool or falling onto a trampoline or repeatedly getting his hat pressed down over his eyes etc
this might sound mildly amusing and maybe it was back in the s but now the whole thing is so predictable and laboured with most gags being repeated ad nauseum that the only reaction is to groan
furthermore it s a musical of sorts and our minimal enjoyment is dampened by some tedious songs
of these only cry hit s the mark being exactly the type of song johnny ray would ve sung and this provides the sole amusing scene in the film when a slightly drunk buchanan decides to have a crack
apparently this was a real show stopper on stage
here it s a brief chance for buchanan to shine and he milks it for all it s worth by the last minutes i was longing to fast forward this particular turkey when out of the blue the film gave us a few minutes of vintage jack in a brief song and dance number after all the plot points were been resolved if the whole movie had been like this few minutes of good humoured hoofing from a guy who knew how then it would ve been a very pleasant experience indeed
unfortunately it isn t and although everyone tries hard too hard it s a laboured piece and unworthy of it s star
well it may be fun to see this soft porn for you but politically speaking this movie is the perfect example of hatred against turkey where the story took place
this is not how it works in this country
also the picture of ataturk the founder of modern turkey was defaced and played on to make him look like a monster
and you should note that the girls are very well treated in greece and very bad treated in turkey
i wonder where the producers of this film are
i like the movie but i does not do the book justice
i actually saw the movie before i read the book
there is so much the movie runs together and leaves out at the same time
it is too obvious that this movie was made for tv
it would be better if the director took the time to read the book and actually see the layout of remember house
the movie is good if you have already read the book and have an inkling to what is going on in the first place
it is an awesome book
i have read a few of mary s books and they are great
bu this version to be transformed into a movie not such a good choice with so little detail
this movie was made for people who have read the book and then they still need a little help
the movie is in my opinion a poor rendition of the book although i would love to know where the house is that it was filmed at
that is the only thing that serves my imagination from reading the book outside only of course
the title and the cover of the dvd box refers to the famous painting by grant wood gothic meaning the style of the picture less the content
being a great fan of rod steiger i could not resist buying the dvd
it is a mixed bag
i just suspect that with a few touches here and there this could have been quite a good movie the start is promising
a young man gets his wife out of a mental institution where she was kept after her baby drowned accidentally
the psychiatrist is really smug he obviously enjoys telling the husband that with his wife anything could happen
the husband decides to visit with her a place where they spent their honeymoon
together with a few friends they board a seaplane an old and dirty and rickety seaplane
i repeat a seaplane that is old and dirty
they take off and guess what happens next
i give you a hint splutter splutter that is the typical start of a good bad movie in anyone s language
the subject is well known in the american horror genre young innocent people meet old frustrated yet colorful country folk
scenes of gore ensue
added to this is the classical island theme of agatha christie s ten little indians the young and innocent get killed one by one
the last surviving member of the involontary expedition fuses with the murderous opponents
follows a gory finale
the end several points are worth mentioning that make american gothic partly watchable
the movie is very beautiful
the plane flying over a group of islands in the opening sequence is visually great and the dark mossy virgin forest of the island where the group gets stranded reminded me of john sayle s limbo whose story has some similarity with american gothic here and there
the set design is also excellent
an interesting aspect in the story is the fact that all the inhabitants of the island turn up out of nowhere
first ma and pa surprise the youngsters in their house which they had entered in a clear case of trespassing opening cupboards taking out clothes etc
later suddenly a daughter turns up then a son then another
this strange and unexpected multiplication of characters has a stimulating effect on the viewer are they ghosts only existing in the imagination are they some kind of mutants
but is left unexplained the acting is not bad at least on the part of the strange family
rod steiger is quite good as the head of the family yvonne de carlo is ok as the matriarch
janet wright and michael j pollard are great as the demented kids
but unfortunately the story leads to nowhere
as i said i think with little changes much more could have been made with this confrontation of new and old today s and yesterday s values
of course this was one these movies your girlfriend make you sit through which normally is ok
normally they aren t this flat and usually these films is more determined at which genre it s going for
this film starts of with the prospect of a romantic drama sprinkled with some comedy here and there which would have been ok
the setup is of course obvious but there might have been some interesting things to show had it been allowed to continue that course
to me it seems as if this film is being instructed by two very different directors because the depiction of alabama population in the last of the movie reminds me most of all of cartoon characters rather then actual homo sapiens
this way to go would also have been fine if it had been taken all the way in stead of betting on two horses like this
had the movie gone for either the farce or the drama i d probably have given it a but it didn t it mixed up the two and got a cocktail of boring and flat out failure

this is a harmless though brainless film
however due to the many logical errors in the film i can t recommend it as anything other than a time passer and only if you can manage to turn off your brain for a while while you watch
otherwise what happens in the last portion of the film might make you either throw something at the tv or curse yourself for investing this much time in a dopey film
now i know that there are many loretta young and probably more tyrone power fans out there and i don t mean to offend them
heck i usually love these actors too but i also can t lie and say it s one of their better films the film starts off well enough and i really liked the first half
adolph menjou is the co owner of this restaurant but he needs to pay off a loan fast or lost his restaurant
so on a lark he gambles and actually earns enough to pay off the money he lent himself illegally and save his butt
however it turns out that the young guy tyrone power who he won the money from is broke
instead of sending power to jail for writing a bad check to cover his losses menjou decides to force power into becoming his slave
and as his slave he has power pose as a russian prince so they can both bilk a rich young lady young of the money to save the restaurant
so far so good now the fact that power didn t do so well with impersonating a russian wasn t a problem after all he wasn t supposed to be perfect and she was supposed to eventually figure out that he was a phony
however and here s where the film gets dumb although she knows he s a criminal she falls in love with him
and insists she must marry him
now we could assume that either miss young s character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get power even after he s robbed them this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point
she barely knew the guy and most of what she knew about him was terrible yet she insisted on marrying him and having everyone live happily ever after
and on top of this ms young yells and bellows and over emotes like mad when she argues with her father about this
oh brother give me a barf bag
the only reason i even gave the film a score this high is that despite being brainless the film had some nice moments and the actors seemed to try hard with material that was simply beneath them
also the film deserves no better than a because some excellent dance scenes with bill bojangles robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released
fortunately they are included on the new dvd version of this film
you ll find the first one simply brilliant and probably better than anything fred astaire ever did
the second cut scene is less brilliant and rather politically incorrect but it s still a shame it was eliminated
first i want to come out and say that i only watched one episode of this show death before dishonor
frankly that was enough for me and i have since used that episode as the lowest end of the scale by which i judge sci fi
from otherworld to vr to the current flash gordon this remains the bottom of the proverbial barrel
i remember the initial buzz this show created what with the resumes of some of the lead actors
i also recall that the visual f x were not bad for the early s
while the actors were doing the best with what they had the writing was severely lacking and reminded me more of a saturday morning cartoon script than anything else
the only thing i took away from this show was that i never wanted to see anything like it again
i was also gravely concerned that this show would make the networks more reluctant to take chances on future sci fi oriented series due to it s quick demise
fortunately that did not happen in the long run but to me space rangers remains the type of show that gives sci fi a bad reputation
i don t seem to understand how so many people have given to kisna
rather i think the only people who can give are subhash ghai vivek oberoi and the remaining cast of the movie purely because they were in it
i think it is one of the soppiest movies i have seen in quite some time
the movie hardly had a plot and whatever the plot was it was extremely clich d
also it wasn t even a decent period film as it mentioned
all the movie had was songs gymnastics songs songs crying gymnastics songs songs
honestly if there was a negative rating then i would have given this movie a or something
it was a complete waste of and odd hours
one of my favorite aspects of this film is how you are fully drawn into hell
in short it some what reminds me of a mad max crossed with the movie legend on an hbo budget
however all those elements come together for a very entertaining and interesting far fetched story line
i hope this one gets put out on dvd
gave it a
i am not in the habit of writing a review for a film that i don t like but i was honestly shocked at how horrible this movie was i couldn t tell what was more atrocious
the horrible acting or the laughable script
i love the idea that lawrence hilton jacobs is finally getting a starring vehicle but his performance here made me see why he never took off in hollywood
it was truly that bad the writing was wooden and incredible
normal people don t speak like these guys did
they go from laughing to crying to anger in minutes
why would you beg a hitchhiker to get back in your car after minutes of driving
why would you reveal such incriminating details of your life story after knowing someone for an hour
why would you allow a stranger with a gun in your car horrible
and the camera work didn t help either
i m no expert but here s a tip when showing a gritty close up scene try taking the camera off sticks and going hand held to get an edgier more nervous feel
i felt like i was watching public access theater for a while there overall this is a good concept for a film
the execution however drowned the story in a sea of amateurish and obvious mistakes that kids in their second month of film school are warned against i wish the actors and crew of this film long fruitful careers in the entertainment industry but you ll need to bury the masters of this stinker for that to occur
two words alan smithee
i recently viewed this film for the first time and found it to be intriguing if not especially satisfying
i apparently viewed this film from a somewhat different perspective than many other imdb voters
i don t know the director s intent but i felt the film exemplified the drawbacks and pitfalls of extreme positions and or lifestyles
the central character vividly portrayed by mimi rogers leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life
viewers can judge for themselves whether one type of extremism is preferable to the other
in my opinion many types of groups or cults politically or religiously inspired capitalize on people searching for a person or group who can dramatically change what they perceive as an unrewarding existence
this film may draw intense positive or negative response from people with extreme religious positions
not placing myself at either end of that spectrum i was deeply interested in the film but felt that it lost some of its impact and possibly a couple of rating points over the final half hour of the presentation mimi rogers gives a strong performance in a film in which she is required to shoulder the burden
it s not that the other actors give sub par performances
it s just that the film is so primarily structured around mimi s character that she is required to carry the load and does so extremely well
in my opinion an imdb rating of between and would seem to fit this religiously provocative drama
i personally gave it a out of and would recommend it for viewers who are not offended by loose sexual lifestyles or exploring intense religious attitudes
i loved this film it absolutely spoke to me in a way that few films i ve seen do my biggest fear throughout was that at any moment the next scene would see sam sean penn and rita the lawyer michelle pfeiffer deciding that the best solution to their problems would be if the both united in a marriage pseudo marriage so they could lay happy families and all live happily ever after blah balh blah ad nauseum
thank god nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece
such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me
obviously nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap opera style conclusion penn s performance is highly commendable more rainman than forest gump
indeed it represents what must surely be a turning point in his career direction
full credit also to young dakota fanning lucy who carried off a superb portrayal of her character and simply stole the movie i ll keep this short but suffice to say if you haven t seen this film you re missing something big
not everyone will go to see this film but those who do will know that they have seen a truely magnificent piece of cinema
well i just got done watching this movie thankfully for free on the scifi channel
i must say i feel sorry for anyone who actually paid to see this movie
although i have learned to not really expect much from the weekend horror movies on cable this one is really near bottom of the barrel material
the beginning was okay and could be considered somewhat good by horror movie terms
however there was very little building on almost any of the characters in the movie
while phil jenkins does have some background build mostly from just a couple scenes where he revealed some information about his past as well as pamela s constant nickname of big city for him
all of the other characters just seem like cannon fodder
there to be picked off at a moment s notice
i wasn t impressed by the gore in this movie either it wasn t in the least bit frightening
that of course could be the effect of seeing a few hundred different horror movies
i think this movie was mostly just slapped together hurriedly with a second rate script and mediocre actors
the acting in the scene where the girl gets out of the car and is crawling across the ground while being eaten by the werewolf is actually laughably bad
the attempt at a good plot twist at the end was pretty lame and very predictable if you ve seen any kind of horror suspense movie similar to this one
the fact that evil thing turns out to be the main character s love interest is pretty dried up in terms of plot twists
it also seems to come very suddenly without any building whatsoever
my overall view of this movie is that it should definitely be avoided at all costs
unless you re an absolute die hard werewolf or random horror fan don t bother with this movie
the premise of this movie is so similar to s seabiscuit you d think you re watching yet another biography of a real horse in some extraordinary inspiring film that might just make you want to head down to the nearest race course and observe a real race but dreamer or sonador as the horse is named takes a slightly different angle in this tale about second chances and comebacks
if compared to seabiscuit yes we have a horse with great potential faced with the troubles of breaking a leg during a competitive race
as with all race horses this means instant death as they have no future value and are bred for the sole purpose of racing we also have a superb trainer ben crane played by kurt russell and the doctor holmes osborne the written off jockey freddy rodriguez the stable hand luis guzman etc
but here s where the similarities end
dreamer is a more personal film with family friendly characters like the daughter dakota fanning the wife elizabeth shue and the grandfather kris kristofferson
nursing the horse back to health had actually brought the family closer together and that in itself makes this film quite clich in its many been there done that before moments to touch dakota fanning has held her own against father figure heavyweights like robert de niro denzel washington and tom cruise though many would have pointed out that she had rivaled naomi watts for the scream queen honors with her performance in war of the worlds
here fanning has returned to more credible acting albeit in a safer role dreamer inspired by a true story is a heartwarming tale about believing in oneself having dreams believing that you can achieve and take action to achieve those dreams
while watching the movie i can t help but chuckle at the parallels in seeing how my team and i are sticking together just like those characters in wanting to see our dream of making a short film and entering it into competitions in this case the breeder s cup come to a reality it s that kind of film an inspiring one
it might be clich d the premise might be too good to be true but hey success might come to those who dare to dream believe and more importantly do
storyline will ferrell as dr rick marshall designs a machine to take him through time and space and he uses it to travel with a female love interest and a trailer trash sidekick to a world with dinosaurs giant bugs and monkey people
they lose the machine and have to find it in order to return home that s the premise but this film is truly truly awful
there are no laughs no smiles
it seems that every character has lines spoken to ferrell telling him how wonderful he is and the whole thing is one huge ego trip under no circumstances should anyone pay to see this film
it s not even worth a dvd rental to be honest it s not even worth the time to download it from the internet
yes it really is that bad
thinking about it i m not a very big fan of michael crichton
westworld is a good film but coma was disappointing and this film looker isn t up to much at all
the early scenes and music indicate that the film is going to be another trashy eighties thriller which is fine by me but suddenly the film slows down to snail pace and despite a few nice murder sequences early on there really isn t much to remember looker for
for this film crichton has took ideas from the worlds of plastic surgery and advertising and attempted to blend them into a horror thriller
to say he wasn t successful would be an understatement as the plot requires a huge stretch of the imagination and the murders that happen early on never get anything in the way of an explanation
the film focuses on an eminent beverley hills plastic surgeon named larry roberts
after performing slight surgery on a number of almost perfect young women he is surprised to find them turn up dead
after doing a bit of research he stumbles on an advertising company called digital matrix who have their own uses for perfect women given that this is an early eighties film you ve got to expect some tacky visuals and an even tackier soundtrack but the film takes these elements and then delivers a story that is far too serious in tone and it doesn t bode well at all
furthermore crichton s plotting is awful as the film quickly becomes boring when the writer director starts forgetting to explain things properly
you can t fault him for imagination as plastic surgery usually leads to an interesting film and there s no end of social commentary that can be sprung from the world of advertising but in failing to capitalise on the story s strong elements crichton has made what could have been a masterpiece into a dull and boring film
the acting isn t bad but again nothing to write home about
albert finney is good in the lead role and he receives welcome feedback from the likes of james coburn and susan dey
the film isn t all bad just mostly and there are a few memorable sequences most notably a young girl falling several stories onto a car roof and a scene at a dinner table towards the end but i m really surprised that this is given praise as an unsung movie it certainly doesn t deserve it
i haven t seen this film for many years but the performances by edna may oliver and james gleason are memorable
miss oliver s performance was brilliant enough to command the release of other movies starring her as hildegard martha withers
this group of movies also represented i believe an attempt by the studio to make edna may oliver who was not british by the way but solidly american a leading lady
that attempt failed probably because she was not a sex symbol
but in the penguin pool murder she wins over james gleason by the sheer force of her character and when he finally succumbs she characteristically responds i thought you d never ask or perhaps she was not cast more as a leading lady because she was simply put unsurpassed as a character actress
it isn t that she wasn t a box office draw for as a gentleman who lived through the golden age of hollywood once said to me who didn t love edna may oliver
geez i love this movie
it s got just about everything a great sort of b movie needs killer dolls caged women rock bands a psycho dwarf with an eyepatch an assassin clown ordained priest and of course a crazed billionaire with a shrunken head
like the tagline says revenge lust and dolls all in an hour and a half
misa kuroi is the new mysterious girl at a japanese high school who knows about witchcraft and this is what has drawn her to this place
something evil is lurking and she s there to put an end to it
she gains respect from her fellow pupils when she confesses to being a witch when she performs curse on a hated teacher and it works
however it all changes when the teacher actually turns up in a very severe accident
she gets the blame as gossip spreads that people close to her die
during an after school exam misa and twelve students get locked in for the night and their teacher has disappeared
when they try to escape there seems to be some sort of force stopping them from leaving and trying to kill them off
there only chance rests on misa but trying to convince them to trust her is another matter we get a change of pace with this quirky surrealistic lurid and highly bold low budget occult supernatural slasher j horror film which is inspired by shinichi koga s s manga comics
yes there s no vengeful spirits here
the film basically exploits its risqu moments at every opportunity with candid lesbian acts teacher and student relationship that follow onto unpleasantly gruesome details in what you can call spicy camp
director shimako sato stylishly paints an edgy shocker with grisly set pieces worked into a claustrophobic atmosphere of dread which hangs over the latter half of the film
the cheap feel to it all works to its advantage with its limited sets basically all set in the school grounds and the adept special effects and macabre make up comes off extremely potent and well organised
while the majority of the pacing in the opening half slowly kicks off in first gear it s not until just after the halfway mark where the tempo gets frenetic and the blood splatter hits the fans
lurking within the haunting context is a cold and creepy tenor which makes the inventive deaths incredibly blood curdling
the sweeping camera work that s dreamt up can capture some uncanny frames and lighting is kept rather under lit to breath a really unsteady gloominess
in the background is a faintly effective and wistful music score
the story is nothing we haven t seen before but it still comes off fresh and stable with its interesting idea which silly overtones can feature and convoluted actions creep up
nonetheless it keeps a disorientating and tense feeling on how things are going to turn out in the end
there s not much of a background to the witch misa in this story as she s pretty much thrown right into this one and we got to accept it even though this vagueness could frustrate
this would be the first of four chapters of this character
and the second entry which isn t too bad and reminded of the terminator would go onto be a prequel which explained a lot about misa s past and how she became to be a witch
the static script throws around plenty of witchcraft mumbo jumbo and lets the mystery unfold perfectly fine with few well disguised red herrings and pawn figures
the usual twists are also thrown in for good measure performances range from brooding to flamboyant but either way it always amused
kimika yoshino in the lead part brings a quiet determination in her strong performance as misa
naozumi takahashi lives it up in the part of the jealous wannabe wizard student and miho kanno keeps it all innocent and soft as misa s friend
a stellar ryoka yuzuki looks steamy but strikes up a flinty barrier in her small part and mio takaki makes for a stoically steely turn as the teacher shirai a dark foreboding teen j horror film in the area of black magic which it s bumpy pacing can get just too causal
well worth the peek for fans
one would think that the bbc and itv would be out to milk every last penny from the great tv programmes of the past
the glittering prizes ranked along with such greats as i claudius fall of eagles and days of hope
i doubt that the tapes have been lost or discarded
if the bbc could produce the old blotchy s recording of george orwell s for its anniversary they have got this one tucked away in their vaults the plot reminded me of the up series where a group of children are visited every years to examine how they are faring in life
the glittering prizes was a work of fiction but obviously based on real life characters who attended cambridge in the s and went on to careers some successful some not
i will never forget the scene with tom conti in his cheap rooms with oh mein papa playing on the radio or the young boy when asked what kind of car the family had replied that they had feet
the evocation of the s and s brought back so many memories
the script was sparkling the acting superb and the concept predated all the ensemble films and reality shows tv has really gone downhill since programmes like this were made
we may have more channels but the result in mediocrity
best of all they were able to get the message across without resorting to gutter language
like others i would like to see this on dvd
trying to conceive of a left behind style film happening to a specific race in a specific state is pretty out there
but director sergio arau does so admirably in a day without a mexican part comedy part mockumentary the film s liberal leanings are sure to turn some viewers off
taking consistent jabs at prejudices and hitting their target more often than not the film takes on the premise that a strange magical fog has surrounded california one fateful day blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic internet access and all forms of communication
and this weird atmospheric disturbance has also taken away all of the mexicans
the disruption to the sunshine state is evident as fruit rots on trees vegetable aisles in grocery stores go empty and car wash patrons have to dry their own cars
lilia rod riguez played by yareli arizmendi like water for chocolate is a television news reporter who doesn t disappear
the supernatural phenomenon seems to have passed her by even though she s mexican
or is she
more unseen prejudices arise as we learn that most anglos label anyone with a coppery toned complexion as mexican lilia learns her true genetic heritage along the way but feels in her heart that she s mexican and promptly vanishes in front of a television audience john getz blood simple plays senator abercrombie who has to take on the position of california governor pro tem as the current governor and lieutenant governor were mexican
thrown into the spotlight the new gov has to deal with all of the chaos caused by the disappearances as well as the disruptions to his own household when their maid nanny cook vanishes other characters include two border patrol officers who are forced to deal with their prejudices when they learn that they no longer have a viable job
this is one particularly hilarious portion of the film that will really tickle audience s funny bones as california tries to deal with the loss of an entire race the remaining folks come up with some great reasons for the mexicans disappearance
some say that the sombrero is shaped like a ufo for a reason wink
others believe it s a form of the rapture and the apocalypse is upon us
still others believe that it is because the other races didn t appreciate the mexicans and so they just up and left
regardless of the reason true or not the effect is felt throughout the state
anglos and other nationalities turn to looting and diving into black market fruits and vegies in order to save their restaurants
talk shows swing from one extreme to the other some saying their glad that the mexicans are gone while others struggle to stay on the air with a skeleton crew many camera operators were mexicans the film s faults are that this probably won t be for those who live outside california
a day without a mexican has a fairly specific target audience
but the great message often funny and poignant at the same time cannot be denied we all need each other regardless of race special mention of the film s musical soundtrack must be made too
the mariachi version of california dreamin is outstanding as is the theme song a day without a mexican
new mobile report gundam wing endless waltz is the movie sequel to the perfect anime
i would recommend this movie to anyone
i love it
it s so great
i can t believe how perfect it is
wow
mothers reading this to see if it s a good idea for their kids this movie is really good
if your kids are sensitive to blood dekim barton gets shot and a bit of blood is visible
but that shouldn t matter because this movie is great
oh yeah and quatre will um teach them to be nice and stuff
this review covers both versions of flatland released in one by ladd ehlinger jr with a mostly unknown voice cast and the other by jeffrey travis with some hollywood big names providing the voices the source material for both is the novella by edwin a abbott but the approaches of the two films differ radically
the book is a staple of science fiction and one of the few to address mathematical issues at its core
being a product of its time the book is technically naive and politically incorrect based on current sensibilities the travis film is visually slicker but significantly shorter and tackles philosophical issues relative to the passage of time from initial publication
as such it tampers with the plot to mixed effect
unlike some others i have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book s major issues into somewhat sharper focus
on the other hand they also add a feel good and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place the ehlinger film is much truer to its source material which is both a strength and a weakness
given a current perspective its th century depiction of the political and social subjugation of women is a distraction that the travis film avoids
it s also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the travis film
where it does tamper with the plot some of the decisions are questionable as other reviewers have pointed out so which is better
in my opinion the short answer is the ehlinger film
despite its length political incorrectness and technical inferiority the animation of the travis film is much more sophisticated it resonates at a technical level to a degree that the travis film can t match
as a scientist this means a lot to me
on the other hand the travis film resonates on an emotional level that the ehlinger film can t match
so the answer may be whether you re looking for technical insight or emotional satisfaction most jarring in the travis film is that unlike the ehlinger film the animators never quite caught on to the implications of a two dimensional universe
it is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film s reality e g
the protagonist s daughter has toys which only make sense to someone with a d perspective and how does he open his briefcase
the cover art is an obvious first impression example
the travis film s characters look more human but ask yourself how their eyes work
one detail of the book is that looking at a flatlander from above all of his internal organs are clearly visible as they should be
travis animators hint at this but don t meet it head on
the ehlinger film s animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as travis but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing or maybe not since the necessary designs were all in the book
in short travis had the budget but ehlinger had the passion for the project albeit perhaps a bit too much respect for the source to create a truly superior adaptation the differences reflect different target audiences though
the travis film is an educational short film which was obviously meant to be viewed by classrooms of middle school and high school students
as such it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non mathematicians
that it includes recognizable names voicing the characters will help it grab a bit more attention an educational short film for the x files generation
the ehlinger film would mostly appeal to people with a college level interest in mathematics or others who are already familiar with the book neither film is perfect but i m giving the ehlinger film a rating of and the travis film a rating of
depending on your sensibilities your conclusion may be exactly opposite of mine so i hope this review includes enough information to guide you to an informed selection or like me you could simply buy both
i was went it was released and i still have more emotional attachment to it than any other movie of childhood even over rocky or star wars
we had a second run theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or cents before o clock so i know i saw it at least a dozen times it played at the theater for about months
my father coached little league for years for my older brother and myself
both are now deceased and i finally took a view at the dvd this week after not having seen it in more than decades
to call it memory evoking is an understatement dad was neither a buttermaker or a turner as a coach
he would come right from work to the field and would be knocking out balls for fielding practice with his dress pants florshiem shoes and always puffing that pipe filled with middelton s cherry blend tobacco
we won our share of games and he always made it a priority that everyone played and that the game was first and foremost fun
we had our share of turner s in our leagues and dad disliked those types to no end
i don t know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name they would ask did your dad coach little league
i had him one year as a kid he was such a cool guy to play for dad thought that bears was a bit over the top with the drinking and language but always admitted that gave him more laughs than any movie he had seen i never saw any of bears sequel s the tv show or the remake
there was just no point
without matthau o neal or morrow i m sure they are as substandard as can be bears really pushed the envelope for it s time forever shattering the disneyesque mode of kid films
what was inappropriate for is now intolerable and deservedly so
but it is those attributes that makes the film so unique i think the character that stands out the most for me is roy turner having been the son of a coach dad
i always left the theater loving dad even more for not being like him
turner gave us a look at what i call lombardi isim
vic morrow was such a great actor
it was hard seeing him playing a villain character when i always thought of him as the heroic sgt
saunders of combat
when the championship game is over and the yankees win i picture that huge trophy sitting in an apartment years later collecting dust and being just about as worthless as the wood and plastic it s made of
still in the possession of a bitter old lonely man wondering what happened with his family some time back i spent a lazy sunday just driving around and came across a league game of year olds
i felt compelled to stop and watch a few innings
oh how things have changed
the game chatter has been replaced with vulgar trash talking
i saw a verbal exchange between a pitcher and hitter that led to a head hunting pitch
nothing was done about it and on the next pitch the batter took one to the helmet
the batter ended up being ok i guess helmet technology has come a long way thank goodness and the pitcher was ejected
i left the game feeling pretty disgusted and for a brief moment i asked myself where was roy turner when you need him
the premise of this film is about a man appointed to be president under unusual circumstance
the current president and speaker of the house tour a building in europe which colapses and kills them both the vice president is ill and can t fullfill the office
the presidency falls to a surprizing fourth in line it s a great story and i don t understand why it isn t on video yet the only small flaw is that it is time dated with the premise of apartied in south africa
everyone write to the studio and get them to put it out on video
it has appeared on tv but they cut it to ribbons and destroy the continuity
arby
i hadn t seen this film for a long time so when it was on television recently i decided to watch it again
i expected it to be cheesy with some fairly ropey special effects
i was wrong the story was good enough and what special effects there were were decent enough
the real highlight though was the lack of cgi this means we get to see a wide range of real us navy aircraft the plot about the uss nimitz a modern nuclear powered us aircraft carrier going through a strange storm which leaves it back in on the eve of the japanese attack on pearl harbour
a pair of the carrier s f s intercept and shoot down a pair of japanese zeroes which have strafed an american boat which happened to have a senator on board
a rescue helicopter picks up the senator his aide and one of the japanese pilots all of whom are shocked at the technology they see the senator is adamant that they must warn pearl of the imminent attack and the japanese pilot who has managed to grab a gun and take a hostage wants to warn his fleet
the captain and senior officers must decide whether they should intervene and change history or stay out of the fight and leave history to take its course the action is pretty exciting and seeing all of those navy jets would have been enough to get anybody who likes military aircraft watching
the acting was good enough with kirk douglas putting in a good performance as the captain of the nimitz
i think it is a shame that there was less discussion about what the consequences of stopping the attack might be both good and bad still it was a pretty good film a must see to any fan of military aircraft
although it doesn t seem very promising for a long stretch renoir s french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film
the story is clich a laundry girl nini fran oise arnoul is discovered by a night club owner danglard jean gabin
danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers
nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too
i m glad the film didn t go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have
the film ends with the opening of danglard s new night club the moulin rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers
the first of them complainte de la butte which also provides the base of most of the film s musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and renoir himself wrote it
if you re a fan of baz luhrmann s film moulin rouge you ll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by rufus wainwright
although it isn t very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen
it s hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl

a generic cop thriller
the boys in blue hunt down a killer stalker who likes to play sadistic games of hangman with the cops to give them a chance to save his victims the only thing in this movie i thought was good was lou diamond philips who seems to be great in everything i ve seen him in
why he chose to do this i have no idea the basic premise could have gone somewhere but there was a great deal of cheesy cliche dialogue and i thought the actor playing the killer was miscast and i have a problem with the director here
was he and crew doing shots of whiskey with the teamsters right before shooting began
i don t like giving overly negative reviews but to tell you the truth after seeing this i think i will pass over anything with ken girotti s name on it
this was just a very poorly directed film
even with the cheesy dialogue it could have been good with lou diamond philips and a director who knew what he was doing
bad bad bad
i don t know what these film makers were thinking
bringing back linda blair to reprise her role as regan couldn t save this
bringing back kitty winn as a tougher sharon couldn t save this
the georgetown house and infamous staircase couldn t save this
so let s bring in richard burton and louise fletcher
we ll make burton a priest and fletcher s character a mother figure for regan
why not
she s the closest resemblance to ellen burstyn we re going to get
i am not even going to go into the whole locust idiocy
let s just say that the producers must have used every locust in the free world to film this movie
bad script bad acting cheesy special effects and a horrific not in the good way ending make this one of the worst films ever made in the history of hollywood movies
on the plus side max von sydow is the only watchable player in the film
my rating out of
its so sad to see some of the dreck that tom berenger has been making in the last ten years or so
occasionally he pops up in something interesting like training day but in small roles
but the projects that he stars in is usually low budget junk and true blue is absolutely junk
berenger plays rem who is a burnt out cop who drinks a lot and smokes even more and looks completely out of shape
he s a widower and his wife was killed by an asian gang
while investigating the disappearance of a girl he gets mixed up with nikki lori heuring who is connected to the case
the usual investigating takes place as rem goes to strip joints and s m clubs and of course everything leads to the asian gang
spoiler alert the ending to this film is so bad and so preposterous and contrived that as a viewer i got a little angry
why do writers and directors continue to have plot twists with his co workers involved and setting him up
its ridiculous
its unbelievable
they did the same crap in the film along came a spider and ruined that film as well
this wasn t a very good film to begin with but this atrocious excuse for an ending makes it even worse
please
i beg you writers and directors out there no more convoluted plot twists
twenty five year veterans of the force are not going to set up other officers for some money and commit murder
no one has ever bought it
and no one ever will
as with many high school english classes we had to watch this over the past few days
unlike most school movies however i quite enjoyed it
robin williams was great as usual a pleasant change from his typical over the top comedy roles
he is one of my favourite actors as he can play so many types of roles so perfectly
the supporting cast was great as well each having their own moments to shine
the film had a very good message to always stand up for what you believe in and to seize the day carpe diem
part of the ending bothered me to avoid spoilers i wont go into why though the final scene certainly made up for it
overall i was pretty surprised with this movie
who knew they d actually make us watch something good in school
i don t know where to begin
darryl hannah s performance was the true highlight of this film
jonathan taylor thomas was very mis cast and the audience laughed every time he came on screen trying to play the bad boy
he just didn t work in the role
the plot was thin
poor editing and continuity
i really couldn t recommend this film
if you want a good film to recommend to a gay bi questioning youth i would suggest beautiful thing or get real
far superior films
britain from time to time produces brilliantly realistic urban films and here in paul andrew wiliams debut feature we have a truly great genre entry that is awash with realism joanne is a year old runaway befriended by young prostitute kelly a tragic event leads to them fleeing from london to brighton on the train in furious pursuit is a pimp and a gangsters son and all of their lives are hurtling towards a night of reckoning this film contains prostitutes paedophiles drugs and violence yet to even think that this film panders to genre stereotypes would be doing it an injustice
this is a gritty realistic picture that thru its bleak story telling manages to make the viewer feel a part of the events unfolding it s harsh and unrelenting in its portrayal of the dark parts of city life that do exist in our world
the screenplay is as lean as a prize featherweight boxer no saggy tag ons no sub plots to bog the story down just a hard as nails story culminating in a wonderful final reel lorraine stanley georgia groome johnny harris and sam pruell your names i hope will get to be known outside of england because you all excellently realised characters that reminded me of people i have encountered during my life
i do hope that you will not be consigned to the forgotten filing cabinet that contains the one film wonders
excellent and unforgettable picture
classy romantic comedies about african americans that neither deal drugs nor go on booty calls were unusual fare for hollywood in the pre tyler perry era
waiting to exhale charted this change of attitude in the depiction of blacks that caught on in later movies like soul food eve s bayou love jones and the wood director malcolm d lee s witty sophisticated but dramatically well rounded yarn the best man is the latest to capitalize on this trend
despite some profanity and raunchy sexual allusions the best man endorses marriage fidelity and religious values
nobody gets shot stabbed or coked up the nose
the characters qualify as intelligent positive upscale role models and stereotypes appear conspicuously absent in this seriocomic account of a weekend college reunion before a classmate s wedding happily the best man shuns racism either as a political issue or as a narrative theme
actually this lighthearted but occasionally down to earth comedy of errors looks and sounds like something oscar wilde or george bernard shaw might have penned
the point is that the best man emerges as a polished mainstream comedy where the characters are first and foremost people with all of the foibles and frailties of mankind
a strong ensemble cast headed by charismatic taye diggs who won over audiences in when stella got her groove back distinguishes writer lee s accomplished directorial debut
unlike his famous more often controversial brother spike lee malcolm sticks to the story and avoids tangents chicago author harper stewart taye diggs of go has just written his first novel
appropriately entitled unfinished business stewart s about to be published story has been picked up by oprah winfrey s book club
life couldn t be better for the novice novelist
the froth of harper s success fizzles when he learns that his ex college flame bet tv producer jordan armstrong nia long of friday has circulated an advance copy of his semi autobiographical effort among his close chums
when harper arrives in new york city for the weekend festivities surrounding the impending marriage of football star lance sullivan morris chestnut of half past dead and mia morgan monica calhoun of love basketball he finds himself up to his ears in hot water naturally harper s friends have perused his novel
they bicker about who he used as models for his fictional characters
things come to a boil when lance suspects the worst
he believes that his sweetheart mia may have bedded down with harper the guy he chose to serve as his best man
reluctantly harper confesses and the once philandering football star blackens his eye at their stag party and then threatens to throw him off the balcony
lance calls off the wedding without warning mia and then storms out of the party
harper realizes grimly that he must patch things up
the next day everybody shows up at the church in their finest garb but poor mia has no idea why lance is tardy the best man is the equivalent of terry mcmillan for guys
they form a closely knit group of friends who have achieved success of their own right after college
predictably their reunion sparks old rivalries and bitter jealousies
harper finds himself in trouble long before he arrives in the big apple to celebrate with his friends
just as his publishing career is gaining momentum harper s girlfriend goads him about a commitment that he balks at giving
quentin terrence howard of iron man is a cynical career drifter who cannot find a woman for himself but who doles out advice to julian murch harold perrineau jr of the matrix reloaded about how to deal with his prima donna girlfriend shelby melissa de sousa of biker boyz
finally lance has decided to settle down now that he has inked a million contract to play for the new york giants the best man towers as a four star romantic comedy in the tradition of the big chill with characters who never get short changed and an ending that is agreeably believable
this cod mockney melodrama from the director of bridget jones diary fails at every level
it s clearly a film involving working class characters made by middle class people with both characters and plot lacking any authenticity and credibility whatsoever
in fact the basic premise of bridget jones is transposed to this disastrous attempt at making a serious drama
instead of writing a diary she writes letters to osama bin laden
instead of getting caught in a love triangle between colin firth and hugh grant she gets caught in a love triangle with two equally wet englishmen uncomfortably played by ewan macgregor and matthew macfadayen and all this after her poor husband and son have been blown to bits in an unconvincing attack on arsenal football stadium whilst she was shagging the local taloid newspaper reporter
the mawkish sentimentality that ensues is unbearable
in a preposterous celebration of london s blitz spirit the faces of the victims are printed on the side of wwii air balloons which float above the city in every shot
and michelle williams who miraculously found her sons toy rabbit in the ruins of the football stadium clutches it to her chest in almost every scene
i find it hard to believe that this ill conceived script ever made it past treatment stage particularly when so many established uk film companies like ch were involved in its development and finance
i find it equally hard to believe that the film was selected to screen at prestigious festivals like sundance this film is a worrying indictment of the failings of a the british film industry
i cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it
i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s
out of the viewers must be going crazyi cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it
i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s
out of the viewers must be going crazy
can a movie be so awful it s actually physically harmful to watch
spr ngaren comes close
i had never watched any of colin nutley s pictures before this one and i can safely say that i will never deliberately watch another one
this is so bad it should be used as a user manual for how not to make a movie
i honestly can t think of a single thing in this tedious waste of film that doesn t suck to high heavens
the story which isn t that interesting in the first place unravels at the pace of a dead man running a marathon
the direction is standard fresh out of film school hey look i just found a camera in the garbage can stuff stunning in its ineptitude and seemingly aggressive refusal to be interesting
the acting is so good it almost rivals the works of ben affleck in terms of charisma and enthusiasm
to be honest for the first half hour i could ve sworn i was watching a satirical comedy about zombie journalists
as for helena bergstr m she deserves a special mention because it really boggles my mind how she ever became as famous even by swedish standards as she is now
she has no acting talent whatsoever and she has a face like the rear end of an infected hamster
sorry helena but it s true and you know it no matter what your husband says moving on to smaller yet crucial aspects of the film the sound musical score and lightning is so sickeningly off in almost every single scene that it hurts to watch
the music for the most part has nothing to do with what s going on on screen the dialogue is muffled and there is a very lazy and ineffective use of natural lightning throughout
to be honest only one scene didn t make me want to gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon and it was a five second shot of some trees
i guess this is a major achievement for someone like nutley the stunning amount of reviewers here who gave the film more than makes me want to commit acts of terrorism myself
how can you find anything about this movie good
send this film to guantanamo where it belongs as a torture device
this was one of my first disney midquel experiences the very first being the fox and the hound
i haven t a clue why disney has taken up this hideous trend
their midquels spoil practically everything about their original counterparts i was and i m sure that others were too hoping for a story about bambi s twin fawns geno and gurri from the novel bambi s children
instead i received this nightmare
i ll not spoil the story for those interested in this garbage but i will say that every classic character was ruined by a chatty modern attitude
the character that bothered me most was the redone faline
she was not at all her adorable old self but quiet reserved and having a slightly darker more dullish brown coat thus erasing all of her original appeal
despite the lovely animation i could not enjoy how disney made such a lackluster and unoriginal followup to one of their most successful films of all time
i suppose to fully appreciate amelie one would first have to appreciate the work of jean pierre jeunet
jeunet creates characters that are sweet simple and of course interesting
amelie as the full title suggests takes place in france
but not quite the france you may know
the france in amelie is borderline between surreal and real making the story of amelie much like a fairy tale
the main character amelie is struggling to find her place in a world in which she does not seem to fit in
she feels finally at peace with her life when she finally feels she has found her goal in life changing people s lives for the better
i don t want to give too much away but overall amelie is a uniquely sweet story with a uniquely sweet soul just like well amelie
having won the pr war there is now no means by which a viewer can allow himself to judge a pixar product as wanting or in this case horrid
a movie so underscripted and over messaged that if you wasted five words describing the plot you d give everything away
audiences still don t know when they re being narratively cheated or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails or become a bloated maddening mess
i never ever imagined when i rented this that i would be swearing at the screen as the unbearable latter two thirds of this movie wore out their welcome so here we are again with the unpromising clich s of a robot who wants to feel love a ships computer issuing a self destruct countdown a crowd that requires one person to save them wall e himself makes sad eyes over and over
the movie milks this in every scene put robot and love into the big hollywood script writing machine and you always get something like this
the movie becomes bloated with surface activity whose conception calls for dragging out tired computer animation and the familiar set of unnecessary lookalike obstacles to be overcome
it devolves into the usual thought and time wasters
in the end things have reached the same frantic overproduced excess that execs have been pushing for years
wall e is exactly as bloated as hello dolly was in
i challenge you to sit through that forgotten dud
in the movie oliver at an emotional bottom the title moppet sings a song called where is love lionel bart was criticized for writing a song with sentiments too developed for a child to voice
while a child may seek the love a missing parent they don t seek love in general as a disembodied ideal
likewise for wall e
here barely three minutes after wall e is introduced he s dreary little headcase pining for love which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film and forces half the problems that ensue
the other half come from the wearying agenda and this is coming from someone who is relieved we are finally in the green era vain high concept viewers have taken pride in their ignorance of a device here which is old news large stretches of silence are novel only to audiences who are unfamiliar with jaques tati the silent minutes that open enormous silent stretches of the ingenious blow up countless other examples and who can t fathom the silent era the movie asks two tiny things of an audience to nod in agreement with its simpleton moral pronouncements and to pass the time distracted by a bunch of surface activity
right in the middle between those two things is where any good movies soul resides what the movie ask you to cogitate over ideas
sorry no ideas here just an abundance of messages towers of garbage taller than the skyscrapers we built check message delivered an indictment of bignesss and wal mart check message delivered headed by a craven ceo check message delivered a single remaining plant check messaged delivered a space ark filled with helpless fatties check message delivered etc
etc
etc
etc
message delivered a glimpse into the future has never been so hopelessly stuck in the narrative past and never looked so much like victorian corn
the movie just cannot rest until a parade of morals has been pounded home
there is little sense of wonder in it
it ain t surprising that it was directed by the guy who made little nemo the movie becomes exactly as dreary tiring and preachy as the premise of a largely wordless movie about ecology sounds
it does not overcome its major decisions
regardless of it s popularity now no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it
it is grotesquely unsubtle hideously preachy wall e is is as insufferable as a dinner guest who explains the correct moral stance on every topic that comes up
message delivered
i think this movie was totally worth seeing
it s shaped around one character who s entire life is centered around fitting in
then the filmmakers take this concept of anarchy and throw this guy into the middle of it
he wants to just fit in but how far will he go
the story twists around his wanting to fit in and his conscience of what is actually right and wrong
the characters are by no means abercrombie and fitch but more normal everyday looking people this movie has depth that some people might not be able to see and even though sometimes it might get slow maybe they did it on purpose for you to reflect or so you can say yeah i m not just watching another mindless movie also this movie points at social issues like the s hippie movement
and how it s shaped us now instead of hippies were anarchist
or how were always trying to rebel against something
it s very interesting to see the new age hippie mixed in with the radical s hippies who are now adults so if you don t want to see another mindless hollywood carbon copy this is definitely an interesting movie to see
wax is very likely the oddest film i ve ever seen
marvelously beautifully lyrically and profoundly intellectually stimulating in all respects
breathtaking in its scope and achievement
but very odd i have read medical reports containing sodium pentathol interviews and transcripts of schizophrenics monologues
i have read memoirs and fiction by schizophrenics and hard drug users
i have read surrealist and beat movement literature
i have read james joyce and gertrude stein
i have read the visionary poetry of charles williams and h d
i have watched films by kenneth anger and david lynch and maya daren
i have read yoruba ethnic literature from west africa and studied aleister crowley s skryings on the enochian aethyrs
i have read h p lovecraft and also kenneth grant s post crowleyan magickal writings describing journeys behind the tree of life which would have preempted h p l
s usual nightmares had he but known of them wax stands tall in that company
a hypnotic hallucinatory purely poetic fusion of words images political ideas and mystical transformations nothing quite resembles it
pi tried for something as distinctive but that film gave us a glowering paranoid tortured vision shot in deliberately painful close ups
wax makes a complete contrast in its joyful freedom of eloquence in narration and visuals wax enhances life while critiquing it
the film employs early simple computer graphics
it juggles idiosyncratic desert architecture prosaic photography and absurd juxtapositions of common images
it tells a story of middle eastern honey bees along with offering a hard view of the original u s military actions against iraq in a time so simple in retrospect as to seem the good old days
it links los alamos with transformations in consciousness
wax leaps beyond the merely political in its luminous metaphors for human existence you can find stronger films more beautiful films more linguistically spry films but you will probably never find anything quite like this fireworks display of language and image
think a space odyssey on a home movie budget
your grasp of reality and cinema may never feel the same
overall it s a nice movie for xu as her second movie as both the director and the leading actress
the adaptation is so natural that nobody would regard the story as a non chinese one
the music is great with lin hai the outstanding composer
the sound of pipa goes smoothly with the movie typical chinese which fits the time background
as for the actors well here is by what i mean it could be better
jiang wen isn t that suitable for this part as the man xu jinglei the director herself isn t mother like enough for the part as the woman
some supporting roles are quite good eg
the old servant
voila
strictly for fans of the king this movie is one of the worst i have ever seen
it looked as though it was written and directed by ed wood without the props falling over
elvis hair changes from one camera angle to another there is no real plot all of the characters are predictable
the only saving grace was well there was no saving grace
it s bad
enjoyed this film which dealt with a mental patient who thinks he was a soldier during ww ii and has a legal license to kill any one he decides to kill
this crazy person is played by marshall thompson gunther wyckoff who is riding in a bus and sitting next to a lady who is trying to be friendly but gunther just looks straight ahead and views a gun that the bus driver had on his sun shade and just gets up and blows this driver away
gunther eventually goes into a bar and locks all the customers in the bar and starts killing the bartender and threatens various other women in the bar
gunther wants to have his doctor john d faron visit him in the bar in order to prevent him from causing all this death to innocent people
there is plenty of tension in this bar and the women in the bar do their very best to try and over power this nut case
i m surprised this film is not higher rated
this is a great film about america and certainly one of the great comedies
walter matthau was born for this role
the kids are impeccably cast
hilarious moving and inspirational
or you ll hate or you ll love it simple as that and i am quite afraid that i rather hate it
the story itself could have been interesting as we follow a couple who have to escape from their hometown i suppose due to political reasons but that s never been explained but everything is seen through the eyes of a boy who is called harry his new identity as in his own created world his hero is harry houdini
oh i wish i could escape from sleep during this movie as it s so dull and slowly filmed that you constantly watch the clock till it s going to end
naaah sorry films with a different view are always more than wellcome but they must have been made good as well otherwise yup otherwise you re bored
this show was extremely pathetic but i would buy the dvd of the aired shows in a minute because they are unintentionally hilarious
for one thing chevy chase seemed to have been strung out on antidepressants horse tranquilizers or something because he was so inept as a host as to seem deliberately horrendous he sat down at a desk with a huge galloon salt water tropical fish tank behind him
this was a novel concept and i liked it
unfortunately during one episode the water had a brownish tinge to it and the fish were obviously dying
it seems that a stage hand with an axe to grind had dumped a cup of coffee into the aquarium
the next show the tank was gone his interviewing skills were so bad as to make carson daly seem like mike wallace
i remember one interview with dean cain where chevy actually smirked at him and suggested that cain was gay
you could tell that dean cain was visibly restraining himself from punching out the inept host this show was quickly cancelled and it s no mystery as to why
this tv made film that i saw on cartoon network wasn t that bad for a scooby doo film
basically scooby shaggy and the very punchable scappy doo are going to a mysterious house to collect some kind of fortune or treasure
while they are looking in this house there is a spirit trying to stop them
so they decide to get a ghost hunting team to get rid of it the boo brothers
they are ghosts themselves but they call themselves frighteners of ghosts
i basically like this for the treasure hunting
scrappy is the only thing ruining this cartoon
if i ever saw scrappy again it would be the last he has so got to die
apart from that though not bad
scooby doo was number on the greatest kids tv shows and he was number on the greatest cartoons
worth a look
this is just possibly the most perfect movie ever made
there is no meaningless dialog not a single extraneous character and every plot twist is rational and reasonable
not to mention a superb soundtrack
because of the intense violence particularly against women it is a disturbing and difficult film to sit through
but if you care about the cinema you must watch without interruption
characters get what they deserve in the beginning and at the climax
let kubrick take you on the emotional rollercoaster of your cinematic life
and don t forget to breathe
while i was on thanksgiving vacation visiting my relatives in america
i saw the film in his life the john lennon story
being a big beatle fan i enjoyed it alot i was impressed with the dramatic performances from irish actorphillip mcquillan
i thought he represented lennons esscence quite well in this movie
what i would like to know is when is he making a sequel
i saw this movie on october of and i have tosay that its a very great movie because it was years older and its most impressive than others when i saw this movie i think was real becausewas so real that i have change the channel to cnnand other news i want to buy this movie or recorderfrom tv but i cant but unless a question a have only say that this is that type of movies that youneed to see because the simplicity is the bestthis is a drama movie but i have to say that thismovie scared me a lot more than other how scream or that type of movies
when this movie was made in sean connery was certainly best known for playing the ultimate good guy super spy james bond who kept the world safe from every bad guy you could imagine
i can understand why connery would want to re image himself especially since his time as james bond was approaching its end
what i have a hard time understanding is why he would choose such a poor movie to do it with
here he plays duke anderson a career criminal who has just been released from prison and immediately begins plotting his next job robbing the six wealthy residents of the apartment house in which his prostitute girlfriend played by dyan cannon in a role that accomplished little except to give a sort of logical reason why this place would be targeted lives
he puts together a team made up partly of guys he knew on the inside partly of old cronies from the outside and one guy from the local mob
throughout the movie it seems as though everyone s being taped thus the title but to no end since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever
and in the end i wondered about the police it looked like half the nypd was on this job i thought this movie was poorly written poorly acted and poorly paced
it s hopelessly dated reeking of the s and with an absolutely dreadful musical score
it lost me right from the beginning with the silly scene of anderson s last group therapy session in prison
it was dull throughout a total waste of time

after their grandfather is violently killed three dysfunctional sisters and their friends take a vacation to the old man s hotel on the lake a part of their inheritance
once there however they re stalked down by a group of murderous psychopaths who have taken up residence in the grandfather s former home with a plot reminiscent of a great s italian slasher like bay of blood perhaps i was very much looking forward to this
as usual the poster was pretty cool but i still didn t have my hopes set high
lucky for me with hopes set low there s less room for them to fall when i m inevitably disappointed
first off the biggest flaw with the film the acting
i just don t get it
there are thousands upon thousands of simultaneously talented and attractive actors actresses in hollywood and beyond that wouldn t refuse a role in a theatrically released horror flick with a million budget
instead we get a reasonably attractive cast without enough talent to fill a proverbial thimble
the writing is terrible and unoriginal and the dialogue is worsened with these actors
the setting however is absolutely beautiful at the southern california ranch in santa clarita
first timer george bessudo worked well with the film creating some good suspense and utilizing some cringeworthy gore
unfortunately teamed with the amateurish script and embarrassing cast it turned out to be a rather muddled mess
the script acting cannot be made up for and the majority of the film feels like a subpar combination of the hills have eyes cabin by the lake remember that one
and any lame teens in the woods horror with rob zombie s michael myers as the killers
i m left with just one question to ask where did the other million go from the projected budget of million
booze hookers
if so i would ve asked the latter to replace the current cast final verdict
dreadful
girl shy is phenomenal
it really has it all
it is a fantastically funny movie about an innocent girl shy everyman who ends up at the end with the big break and of course the beautiful girl
the romance is absolutely breathtaking
the pathos is inspiring practically had me in tears
the comedy is genuine indeed the fantasy sequences are very very interesting to say the least
the ending chase scene is cinematic genius
its similarity to the ending of the graduate is eerie
released years ago this film had me on the edge of my seat throughout
one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
harold lloyd is a forgotten hollywood icon
with the dvd release of his greatest films including girl shy that will undoubtedly soon change
not filma making s finest hour
i felt this movie was just to obviously silly
nothing really memorable or interesting about it in an odd way it reminded me of weekend at bernie s
i think the movie tried to be funny in a very obvious contrived way
not the worst film ever made but certainly not one that makes it s mark in any way shape or form
this being the last abbott and costello film i m not surprised that it went downhill
in my opinion abbott was a minor character and i didn t laugh once in watching this movie
we ve gone from good old slapstick and walking into walls to making fun of the stupidity of lou
he loses everything and we get that horrible tragedy atmosphere
then they squeeze a minute happy ending in and you never lose it
all in all this movie although it has a nice blurb on the back stinks
this was one of the worst movies i ve ever seen
absolutely no suspense
a lot of really bad acting
very poor special effects
avoid wasting your time with this one
nothing more to say but here s the required minimum th line anyway
after the suicide of his wife amy irving david callaway robert de niro takes his mentally disturbed year old daughter emily dakota fanning to a new home in the country in upstate new york
instead of getting better emily begins to withdraw further and she announces to her father that she has a new imaginary friend named charlie at first her father sees charlie as a way for emily to express her feelings
then a series of vicious acts such as menacing writings appearing on the bathroom walls and other mysterious occurrences start happening around the house
david blames emily for doing them but emily says that charlie did it
but is charlie imaginary
you d have to ask emily who is the only one who can see charlie
charlie may actually be both real and very dangerous
the movie is well crafted and suspenseful with a great cast
for a thriller i did jump a few times
the ending was a little disappointing but not unpredictable
th century fox run time rated r
but then again i completely hated the first one the children of gatlin who killed their parents back in cotc are rounded up and bused to the neighboring town
no investigation trial psychiatric evaluations just taken in by idiots
along comes reporter terence knox who s having a terrible road trip with it estranged son
they decide to stay in town so dad can get the story and son can act like a whiny punk
soon enough the freaky gatlin kids start getting religious again and kill a few adults
no one seems to notice they all stand in a pack and brood next to the person who ends up dead
most of the idiot town gets burned alive at a town meeting but not before some toxic corn subplot is introduced
the movie ends with a good old fashioned showdown in spite of a few decent gore scenes the grossest scene in the movie is a terence knox sex scene that may hold the record for fake sweat in a mainstream movie
actually i m still not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or not
while this movie was not exactly earth shaking it was a well made film that held my attention
it s about lady friends who are waiting for their husbands to meet them at their summer retreat
while waiting they begin to tell their innermost secrets about their marriages particularly the details of boredom or infidelity
the most memorable one of these is the final segment with the husband and wife stuck in the elevator though they all were well acted and interesting
those who are great fans of the later depressing work of bergman may find this movie a bit of a letdown it should appeal to those in the audience who want greater depth in the plot without the hopelessness that accompanies many later bergman films
feestje
has all the characteristics of a bad dutch movie it s main actor is a year old playing a student there s meaningless unfunctional sex in it and the story doesn t make any sense
you can have worse times though ruud van hemert brought his dynamic duo from his previous flop ik ook van jou back into this one and i must say that van erven dorens is likable in his role although one can tell it s not acting which he does for a living
kamerling meanwhile isn t the actor a lot of people once thought he would be and picking roles like this one won t help either the story ben van erven dorens is about to marry talita chantal janzen and is been bragging to her parents about his best friend and best man thijs kamerling
he does this so well they want him to plan the weddingparty
while thijs really is a sloppy student only believing in one night stands and hating couples and marriage things complicate when social worker susan daphne bunskoek steps into his life and he wants to start off his own bar restaurant the movie at times is extremely messy watch the scene where thijs and susan are in the kitchen at night talking
it seems that in every shot they are standing in another part of the kitchen and the acting as said before is only so and so
still i had an ok time with it what couldn t be said about ik ook van jou ps if you re a big chantal janzen fan you can skip this one as she has about line in it
what a lovely movie to look at
wonderful costumes and sets make this movie a real treat to the eye
some of the best i ve seen in a period horror film
the acting is also quite good
it s just too bad that this is all the son of dr jekyll has to offer it s easy to see why this film was titled the son of dr jekyll and not the son of mr hyde
other than the opening scene where hyde i m not entirely sure it was hyde has about five minutes of screen time we see him for less than seconds in the rest of the film
very disappointing
without hyde dr jekyll has a tough time carrying a movie by himself the movie is really more of a crime mystery than a horror regardless of how it is listed on imdb
the son spends the majority of the movie tying to figure out who is framing him as mad killer
while it is a decent enough idea for a movie the killer s true identity is given away so early that there are few dramatic or tense moments later on
mediocre performances aside there were a lot of missed opportunities in this movie the miscasting of finney and dey is a big problem
finney is not the right actor for the role of the protagonist romantic lead and you can t help feeling he s just picking up a paycheck
he certainly doesn t put any effort or sincerity into the part
dey is just plain wrong in a role as a model with supposedly perfect and symmetrical features
dey is cute and great in many roles but crichton really needed someone who actually has a symmetrical face as a director and unfortunately also as an author crichton puts much effort into some details and none at all into others
why for example does the main bad guy thug move items unnecessarily when searching an apartment
the victims always notice that the items are out of place or missing
that s just stupid
plus why kill off people under such obvious and suspicious circumstances
it s not like the police don t investigate murders
an intelligent assassin also wouldn t use a submachine gun in a doctor s office the looker weapon wouldn t fit in a standard pistol holster a sink won t spray water out of the drain when hit by an errant bullet yada yada there are some creepy sequences but far fewer than crichton intended
worth seeing if it s on scifi but don t waste a rental on it
i never did understand why it was necessary to kill any of the models either
haunted house is a waste of digital space upon a d v d
disc i have ever seen
i have watched crappy movies before but this has to be worst thing i have ever seen
this did not even resemble a movie in the least
the structure lighting writing acting and direction is the pits
i cannot believe this movie was even distributed in a major video rental chain store
i mean i can not find one thing good to say about it
the flick was padded out to the extreme and the film makers seemed to have run out of ideas and other ways to extend the running time past seventy minutes the movie begins with some thirty something frat boys hanging outside of what appears to be a spooky house
they seem to be reliving and old urban legend about people disappearing inside a ghost house
if you have heard the tale before it s old news a kid walks in and never comes out and the frat boys come and and find him dead of fright the boys soon fall victim to a death curse
the tale is told by a really bad film maker he convinces his friends a group of old teenagers to hang out inside and outside an empty structure that looks like a cross between a barn and a large doll house
after torturing the audience with some of the worst movie making the world has ever since i have seen cable access shows with better film making skills and production they give us a cheap payoff by repeating what happened in the beginning
the movie ends with voice overs still pictures and rehashed footage they should take all the copies of this movie and bury them with the million copies of unsold e t
atari games out there in the new mexico desert
asylum should also be punished for helping to release this garbage
this movie failed all the simple logical steps that are needed to create a watchable movie
haunted house had no acting lame writing terrible direction no lighting and gutter level production values avoid like the plague
having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the s most being quite good to superb and only very few being mediocre my opinion is that this one is the worst of all in fact i think it s so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series
it s not that the story is so bad although it s not particularly outstanding in any way but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters meaning those other than the regulars in this case
barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer and who is on a mission of a sort
she practically calls in the role from a phone and shows no real emotive abilities here
although usually she s never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film tv roles usually small parts she has done much better arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term ham and is the only actor ever on a s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison
and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less which gives him more impetus to overact and he does so other than these two leads being so weak the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first minutes
i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original broadcast as pre teens
his reply was yeah you re right skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before
this movie has exceeded my descriptive capacity
it is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen
not the worst of the year not the worst of the decade one of the worst ever
despite the name cast the acting was simply embarrassing
it wasn t acting as much as posing
i never did really decide if the dialogue was supposed to be that cliched for its campy effect or if they really meant it and the dialogue was the high point of the writing
listen to donald sutherland s accent and tell me he wasn t doing a parody
the script is as disjointed as it is well silly is the only word that comes to mind
the editing is so clumsy that you feel you are looking at a st year film school project and not a good one at that
roger ebert gave it a minimal one star rating and i can t believe he was so generous
this is a real stinker
this film was a waste of energy time and money
in a sense this movie is interesting but mostly intense
the four quarters of the film did a so and so job
the one i find the most disturbing is the part where a group of hispanic youths decide to loot a disgrace to hispanics everywhere along with all other riot scenes and junk
i find it hard to believe that one of the latino kids would thank and praise rodney king for this looting
king didn t want this and he didn t say to riot
mlk jr would turn over in his grave
i can t try hard enough to understand this garbage racism and riot
to bse it s ok to say your opinion but try not to be racist you twit ok
the latino boy didn t suck though he played the looter
i can t believe i wasted my time posting this though it stinks
some junk for your head
now here is a film that that makes the most of this medium and gives it its worth beside or if you like above a book
the settings were so beautiful the environments the historical portraying the story the clothing and not the least to mention the acting
i so much admire the skill of creating such a masterpiece it s like depicting one s dream to become reality
there has been paid so much attention to every detail you can tell the director is a true artist
and i must say the play of jolie and banderas is excellent and they fit so well in their roles
what s that with the low ratings
have people lost their sense of beauty
or is this site mainly used by that flat type of action lover
is recognition of quality a dying feature
let s not hope so for it would be an eternal sin to be for lack of interest restrained of these kind of movies in future
its could be that my love of cult japanese films in general gives me a bias but i rate this film among the all time greats of cinema
lady snowblood takes a good old fashioned period revenge story and turns it into something greater than just a good genre film
the direction and cinematography are top notch throughout with evocative use of reds and whites in the color scheme in keeping with the character of lady snowblood
the acting is solid in general with meiko kaji standing high above the rest in her as the eponymous heroine
her combination of divine looks cool demeanour and bloody sword wielding skills is never less than hypnotic and by the end of the film her impact is breath taking
for the lead character alone this is a great film but it has other virtues
there are great sprays of blood during the fighting and a decent body count with the action pretty well choreographed
it isn t quite as manic as the lone wolf and cub pictures highly recommended but more effective than the action in something like sex and fury also highly recommended
the action scenes are tempered by a poignant edge the way that yuki is kind of a tragic character and the ultimate sadness of her quest and the way her principles end up working out in practice
though her revenge is depicted in the finest most righteous manner the film continually questions the point of it
the quality script adeptly walks a line between mythologising and realism giving the film greater depth and intelligence than a lot of its kin
i can tthink of anything that i don t appreciate about this film it is one of my all time favorites and i can t recommend it enough to pretty much anyone
this movie is a real turkey
while almost nothing happens r burton looks scared from the beginning until the end
the girl who plays regan is miscast i wouldn t rely on her to save the world the new age message is absolutely laughable and the whole movie is as pretentious and empty as one of nicholas roeg s
one has to be very impressionable to like or even be scared by this one
lust for a vampire is the second film in the karnstein trilogy based on the novels by sheridan le fanu
the sequel to vampire lovers starring ingrid pitt and prequel to twins of evil starring playboy playmate twins mary madeline smith lust for a vampire was hindered in its production from the off set
legendary hammer director terrence fisher was forced to pull out and peter cushing was replaced by ralph bates in the lead role
yutte stensgaard plays the truly beautiful mircalla a lesbian vampire who is torn between her love for her teacher and her lust for blood
this film has a very cosy atmosphere very traditional of hammers work around the late sixties early seventies
the sets are reasonable and although highly criticised for her performance yutte does her job well i could go on for pages but as an overview i would highly recommend this film even if it does dabble in as much romance as horror
i first saw this movie when i was five years old and i loved it
for many years afterwards this movie remained in obscurity to me it seemed i was to never see it again until one day i put it on request
i know own it on dvd i whenever i m in the mood for something funny i watch this movie
abbott and costello are my favorite comedy duo they made some of the funniest movies i have ever seen
though martin and lewis had beaten them out of the top ten box office in the later years the are still considered the best that martin and lewis team they are very funny but they cannot hold a candle to abbott and costello the greatest of them all
abbott and costello are the kings of comedy
very funny

bruce willis stars as john mcclane a nyc cop who finds himself the only one who can stop a terrorist hans gruber alan rickman who has taken over an office building and is holding thousands of people hostage in this exciting and jaw dropping actionflick which isn t only a movie but a pulse pounding experience
die hard is a genre classic best watched on dvd with excellent sound effects to test your speakers
this flick has one of the most incredible casts ever assembled for a b movie
you ve got christopher lee donald pleasence fresh from halloween barbara bach former bond girl woody strode those who ve seen spartacus aren t likely to have forgotten him capucine inspector clouseau s wife in pink panther even the legendary director john huston not his first useless supporting role remember tentacles
unfortunately none of those performers get a chance to stand out and do anything memorable the story is confusing although the main villain s hidden identity is easy to guess and karate expert lewis who stars knows all the right moves but has little acting charisma

floricienta is a comedic telenovela that can easily be watched by the whole family
it has the typical characteristics of a cris morena telenovela the magic the musical groups etc and of a telenovela in general a poor girl falls in love with a rich man a fake pregnancy etcbut it is fun to watch and can make you laugh spoiler however if you don t already know it fede dies and flor s prince changes supposedly fede returns to earth and enters the body of max or something like that that is quite annoying because after all this trouble they went through they didn t even manage to get married really unreal weddings cris morena again
but in the end flor marries her prince and they live happily ever after while the villains end up in jail
this episode is very interesting and it is start of a new era
this is the beginning of the scully abduction story line which increased and became a great success
without the abduction half the story line wouldn t have happened all thanks to duane barry
duane barry is a very interesting character
anyway now i will say good and bad things about this episode the good wow that was very brave of mulder to go in there
oduane barry talking in rd person
xdfinding out her might me lieing in the end
wow the bad the torture scenes
conclusion a good episode all over

plot a special strike force team is sent in the jungles lead by dutch arnold schwarzenegger for what he believe to be a rescue mission
but come to find out they were sent to stop a small army from crossing tons of weapons into the country
after they destroy the camp they soon relies they were tricked and expendable
thinking this is the end they proceed to the check point where the helicopter will take them home
but they are then hunted down one by one by an invisible enemy
then find out this thing isn t human and is a hunter of unstoppable and futuristic tactics never seen on are planet
a hunter from another world my spiel this movie is absolutely one of my favorites
from a time i watched this movie for straight months for every day
some days i watched it more then once
i had this on a terrible vhs tape
but for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span i wanted to watch it again and again
this movie is full of everything from blood guts bullets knifes aliens war soldiers death
all those mix to make the true guy movie
granted this movie has it s flaws but come on this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters
there have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail
i can t urge people enough to just watch this for what it is
the ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by dutch arnold schwarzenegger
that has already been tricked into doing a job also in degree heat and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces
from the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene
but this movie true message is the fact that dutch is left to fight the predator without the use of military weapons but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him which completely throw the predator for a complete loop or does it after screening this movie to many times to count i have come up with a conclusion about the end
i believe that poncho richard chaves the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher survived at the end
well i believe he was in the lap of anna elpidia carrillo in the helicopter at the end
because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face
and the only one with that short of hair at the time was poncho and heck i think anna came back for him granted he did get hit by a huge log but who the hell else could it be
also on another note in predator they talk about only two special mission force members survived and i don t know what this means to you but anna is no special forces member
this is truly something that has bothered me for some time
but this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes sci fi horror action
predator review
i rented this movie from my public library along with beverly hills cop and the first two were really great and when i was about to put it in i had a thought of how bad could it be well the first minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away i only became excited once when they had george lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much
my suggestion is see the first two movies and dont ruin them by renting this god awful one
the bottom line is that it had a very bad plot very bad acting not enough comedy my rating
the music is a very pleasant adaptation of several western medieaval tunes the magic realism which north america has laid somewhat of a claim to is lovely used here of course giving a true canine touch to the supernatural stuff the scenery and imagery is breathtaking

and the many boys who s story this is are a delight
with it s colorful comic events and adventure it became my favorite mama plays great too and the director has a gentle and good touch for all the other kids which means he is a fine craftsman though details elude our memory i recall an inexplicably cheerful little man and people in colored saran wrap
i fail to see what was great about the land other than a volcano that burped glitter
moments after viewing it i need only say the title to send everyone into fits of laughter and gagging sounds
this earns the doghouse fire my resounding two thumbs way up
were we to judge it on a star ratings system it would be a spangled banner soft laid back nostalgic and utterly charming this story is a heartwarming winner and can t be recommended enough

what an enormous pleasure
this has been one of my top five favorite movies since the first time i saw it
steve martin and carl reiner are a pair nothing less than genius from two of the best
it is hard to imagine what the editors must have been thinking when splicing together all of the scenes in this movie
the writing fits perfectly and melds steve martin s rigby reardon character with scenes from some of my favorite film noir
favorite scenes include rigby inviting himself to a party hosted by ingrid bergman the scenes with humphrey bogart talking about bogey s tie too funny rachel ward s juliet removing the bullet from rigby s arm and it goes on and on
this is a must see for fans of steve martin carl reiner and all of those wonderful old movies
iron jawed angels follows the true life stories of alice paul lucy burns and the other brave suffragettes who fought for a woman s right to be heard in the government
what a fabulous movie
a topic that could have been boring was brought to life by director katja von garnier as well as wonderful performances by julia ormond molly parker vera farmiga and the amazing hillary swank who brings chills with her powerful monologues
the soundtrack despite not being from the s or s is also a great listen an important piece of history brought to life that all women should see and appreciate
though moderately entertaining there are too many things you have to overlook to make it one cohesive movie
so let s begin
let s first overlook the fact that the movie butchers physics you would think they d at least bring someone on staff that knows something about wormholes etc
to at least attempt to ground this movie in science
they didn t
since it s a fictional movie this is forgivable we ll overlook that it producing wormholes can t possibly happen and the science behind it is laughable
secondly they never really explain why there are two of him is this some sort the prestige rip off
my thought is if you send someone into the past that s changing the past and there is only one of the person you re not cloning someone they use all this fake science mumbo jumbo to make you try to answer your own question or just ignore the fact there s two of him
give me a concrete answer on why there s two of him and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn t worked before why this time
because it s denzel
it also seems they kind of just ignore the fact he most probably killed his partner probably people on the highway by driving recklessly if not killed paralyzed to save the girl that he had a crush on real romantic
let s also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing because they should be arrested for that considering that s pretty illegal and inappropriate
i m going to start rambling so bear with me she pulls a gun on him and he makes a joke that he didn t know that was going to happen but he really should have they pass it off as a joke because they can t explain that scene
the ending where they drive the truck off of the boat in a stroke of divine intervention they crash through all the immobile cars with the distance they had maximum they could be going mph yet they plow through and manage to not only drive the truck off the ship but get it way up in the air to flip around
that s impressive
my last huge qualm about the movie is when he heads towards the bayou at the end he s in such a hurry yet at the girl s house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry
that scene would lack any suspense if they hurried up at her house and didn t park right out front of the bayou in my opinion this movie would have been better served having denzel die the girl get sucked into the ships propeller to have her fingers cut off and wash up on the ocean shore to show that you can t mess around with the past or to elaborate more on the human sacrifice line of the movie
this film directed by eric styles has the distinction that it has reversed the emphasis from a woman to a man for being the object of sexual desire
otherwise it doesn t make much sense
the best redeeming factor is some of the great views of paris sarah as played by melanie griffith is annoying
that little girl voice in a grown up woman is a turn off
this is a mature woman that has taken up with a much younger and attractive young man who is seen naked and or in different stages of it in the film
sarah makes a grave mistake in taking the train back to paris and holding the precious coin in her hand while she falls asleep
hellooo
she could have hidden in some other part of her body jack the young man about town is attracted to the newly arrived american ingenue jenny
they immediately fall in love and are seen having sex without any protection
sorry but has anyone heard of aids
jenny is made to look terribly provincial with that horrible permanent and her even uglier pigtails the film doesn t go anywhere as we figured what was going to be the outcome early on
the direction doesn t help matters at all
other than a vacation in paris what is malcom mcdowell doing in this movie
he only appears in one scene and is seen in another
this film could have been cast with lesser known actors and probably would have been better than what one sees on the screen better luck to mr styles next time out
the made for tv film primal force begins with frank brodie ron pearlman waking up from a recurring nightmare about his mate being killed by some baboons
there is a knock on frank s door he answers it standing before him is a guy named scott davis mark kiely who has been told that he knows san miguel island better than anyone else that he needs his help to lead a rescue mission as a plane recently crashed there
eventually brodie agrees together with a female medic named tara matthews roxana zal a computer guy named stan kovacs julian sedgwick eddie mendoza guillermo rios who carries a gun gets in the way does very little else they set off for san miguel island
meanwhile on the island itself the three survivors the pilot jimy hefner a real estate guy named deutsch richard fancy a pretty young girl named kelsey cunningham kimberlee peterson whose father is interested in buying the island are deciding what to do when a group of vicious genetically altered baboons kill the pilot
kelsey deutsch just sort of run away
our heavily armed group of rescuers lead by brodie arrive on the island via boat
scott feels brodie is withholding some information but they troop on regardless of all the human animal skulls they find
they find kelsey deutsch but they are all attacked by the genetic baboons
the baboons now know they re on the island will stop at nothing to kill the intruders as brodie has to use his experience firepower to keep everyone alive with varying degrees of success
if that wasn t enough the guy bruno danza driving the boat has buggered off leaving them stranded the baboons have killed kovacs destroyed the radio equipment
as the survivors run low on ammo morale they decide to fight back against the baboons directed by nelson mccormick i thought primal force was an ok time waster but nothing that overly impressed me
the script by micheal thoma is about as clich d as you expect of this sort of low budget tv production
first the characters there s the moody unshaven hero with personal demons to exorcise but turns out be be a throughly decent chap in the end the clean cut hero the computer whizz the tough female character the token nobody who is there to die nothing else just so something happens the character who has other more mysterious motives for being on the island
the innocent plane crash victims aren t any better with the young pretty girl who screams a lot the annoying selfish fat guy who doesn t care about anyone but himself
then there s the story a group becomes stranded in an isolated location can t call for help sound familiar
group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nail biting not climax been done yeah
genetic experiments gone wrong
one character who gets abducted by the enemy is not killed for some unexplained reason unlike everyone else who are killed on sight
you probably get the message
having said all that for what it is i thought primal force was ok rolled out the clich s with a certain degree of entertainment value
ron pearlman as the muscle bound wise cracking brodie is great almost makes primal force worth watching on his own everyone else is utterly forgettable
unfortunately one area where primal force loses a couple of stars is in the violence department basically it hasn t got any
this was obviously made with a fairly young teenage audience in mind as the blood gore nastiness is kept to an absolute minimum
the killer baboons are just people in monkey suits nothing particularly spectacular
technically primal force is ok it s very mtv in style with quick cuts jerky hand held camera movements during the attacks slow motion bleached colours every other flashy pointless trick you can think of
on the plus side the mexican locations on occasion look stunning a few nice shots here there captures it well
overall primal force isn t particularly good but it ain t particularly bad either just sort of average i think a decent helping of blood gore would have helped no end to improve it
this show freaks geeks is so good and it s just like real life
this show is realistic in some ways and it always has a funny side to it
i think freaks geeks is funny and that s the reason why i watch this
i wish it was never cancelled and i wish there were more episodes
they should keep making more episodes because it is very kool
i think everyone should be watching this great tv programme
this is one of the best programmes i ve ever seen
whatever you do how intoxicated you might be do not return to salem s lot
even if you ve been there in and somewhat liked it you re going to be horribly disappointed if you return
if you want mainstream horror there s always carrie cannibal holocaust and cannibal ferox just to name a few
if you enjoy the acting of michael moriarty and the writing of larry cohen you should check out q instead the only thing i liked about this movie haven t read the book was the unorthodox portrayal of the vampire race
it s always enjoyable watching on screen stereotypes being torn apart
this movie was terribly made
of course it was a little too much like puppet master though the characters i mean the dolls as characters were too much like demonic toys
oh what the heck they are mixed up
like i said this was a terrible movie
the clown faced and the small headed dude were kind of silly characters now i know why small headed dude wore a mask because his head is too small
this movie does not deserve a sequel at all
these characters should be in the demonic toys series
and where do they get the actors to make these movies
are there that many persons working at odd jobs around the movie business
to say nothing of the director who also wrote this mess
a great story that should have been a great movie
it s unfortunately pretty poorly directed and the writing could have been tighter
i can still appreciate it for what it is and hopefully writer director nichols whose debut this is will come up with something as good in the future and do better by it
michael shannon douglas ligon and barlow jacobs play three men named son boy and kid
their father left them when they were kids which led to their mother abandoning them emotionally
son the oldest basically raised them and their lives are pretty lousy though seemingly normal for the setting rural arkansas
when they hear their father has died the three men attend his funeral and speak badly of the man who couldn t have cared less about them
this deeply offends the old man s second family consisting of four brothers and a war begins between them
what the film really has going for it is the great characterizations very well performed by mostly amateurs
i pegged michael shannon last year with his performances in bug and before the devil knows you re dead as being one of this generation s finest actors and he does well by that promise here
nichols almost undoes it all with awkward pacing and way too much wallowing in the town s redneckiness
the film is mostly pitched as a serious indie with copious comic moments all involving how trashy everyone is
the movie probably does not play well in the south
i think maybe the script s biggest problem is that it really contains only one idea and nichols doesn t want to spend it all in one place
leo is the kind of film few people will have heard of and that your local video store dealer will try to get you to rent because he knows nothing about it either and wants you to check it out for him
that s what happened to me at least
and with a cast this interesting why not
let me tell you why not
this is a very ambitious attempt to deal with themes of identity child abuse guilt redemption and acceptance all wrapped around james joyce and his ulysses for christ sake
with almost none of the requisite writing or directing talent to back up all that ambition
the director appears to have relied upon his good cast who undoubtedly came aboard due to the ambitious script
but acting talent can only go so far here it stops well short of productivity
elizabeth shue is particularly wasted emoting to beat the band in a role that is one note well one and one half and tiresome
a young actor named davis sweatt does wonders with the main character as an adolescent and joseph fiennes is fine too
deborah kara unger gets abused again she s got to stop this sort of thing dennis hopper is his usual nut case and sam shepard s laconic and macho
by film s end almost anything good has fallen away and what is left seems like pure pretension
it s rare to see so much possibility come to so little
salt water tabby is another nice little classic by the duo tom jerry
it is one of their funniest apart some violent gags for one thing the designs general quality and artwork of this short is quite pleasant like in much of the cartoons from those times
because this one takes place in a beach on a summer day it gives the impression of being a summer blockbuster
he he he there s lots of humor and funny gags on this one starting by the way tom introduces himself to that pretty female cat and the way he tries to impress her
another funny thing about tom is that he eats her hot dog and drinks her soda right after that there comes more comical moments our little rodent friend jerry is in the picnic basket throws a tomato and a banana peel and eats salami from a few sandwiches
next jerry throws a couple of eggs to tom s eyes
tom s eyes sure look funny with those eggs and some decorations lol however the most hilarious moments of this short are when tom drinks sand instead of sugar in the coffee
that is so funny
and then tom tormented by the sensation of having his mouth full of sand drinks water from the bucket but it s ocean water and tom spits it straight to the female cat s face
oh my god that is hysterical
it s true that jerry is kinda mean by doing those things to tom but it s just so hilarious overall aside the violent gags with a crab and some of other kind this short is among the most amusing by tom jerry
i m a little shocked that michael madsen was in this movie
he is one talented actor
he could have done much better than getting involved with vice
i tried to keep from stopping the dvd player to pull vice out
but that s what i did
the movie is sloooooooow
it moves at a crawl
super boring action
i don t know when i officially had to turn it off before it put me to me sleep
i do recall daryl hannah talking to michael madsen in car then getting out
daryl hannah is way hotter with curves than she was in wall street
she s a timeless beauty
even michael and daryl could not save this one
the plot written on the dvd sounded like it was was going to be smoking like a inferno of action
it was more like a match of boredom
the dvd was only playing minutes before my gf asked me what s this about
it was taking so long for a plot to develop that it lost us
if you need help going to sleep one night rent vice
it will do the trick
while this movie is slow in some scenes i highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves romance light humor and music
if you remember hearing the lyrics you light up my life then you should also enjoy the soaring lyrics if ever i see you again by the same composer
of course there are other pretty songs to hear
the story line of this movie is clear a widower with two children who is tired of his work as a jingles writer
meeting a former very beautiful lover is a romantic way toward change
it s certainly nice to watch a movie that people can calmly talk without yelling at each other
the movie also encourages you to fly coast to coast without fear
pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience
deal only in big topics such as life death and god
make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc
depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt
and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaim this movie is pretentious faux intellectualism at its boldest
not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions they re afraid to pose the questions to begin with
the film is held together by wisps
directions are raised and dropped awkwardly
pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary
there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will miss critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about
good news neither do the filmmakers
satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius
sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits
with movies like this i wonder how no one thought to stop thething long before shooting wraps
movies like yor force me toargue for a referee who can bring a halt to shooting a troubledmovie much in the same way a referee saves a boxer in danger
when would the ref have brought an end to things
reb brown sfirst appearance might have ended it or maybe the first papier mache dinosaur would have brought the ref s arms up
eitherway we would have been saved from minutes or so of thisdrag
as an old rock roll road dog who played for years and later went into production and management of younger rock bands i think this movie has a lot to say on many levels
i m not going to comment on a review as such but the internet tv view listing i saw when i went to see if it was going to play again said that these kids had gotten good dispite the way the teacher had gone about doing it to me it s funny how a little rough language towards the kids says somehow the teaching method was a failure without giving away anything about the movie i will say this i remember going to a school as a young child where i was in a talent show
i rehearsed for weeks and won after it was over i realized that everyone had won something all kids i was placated into thinking that was how life worked then wham the reality of musical life hit me when i went on the road in the real world let s face it people as a rule and young people in particular are basic under achievers
sometimes all it takes is a little bit of frustration love to make it all click
music itself is a passion not a method and rock music even more so than most as a parent myself i would suggest this movie to anyone who has a musically inclined child not matter what genre they wish to pursue competition is within ones self not against everyone else
if the fire of music is in a child it will come out if handled right if not then thats ok also but don t let it just die as a faint ember of creativity fan it into a full flame of artistic expression
great news
someone is selling dvds of the entire series on sell com plus shipping and i bought the series
she obviously spent a lot of time on them since the discs are really well done
my husband i had forgotten lots of details of various episodes and it s like seeing old friends again
it s hard to believe that years have elapsed since the show ended we love d various other police shows such as homicide and we re also devoted viewers of law order and law order svu but nothing can compare to high incident
we ve remarked that not only was the acting superb and very natural which was rather amazing when considering that many of the actors were relative unknowns at that time but also the action it s like we re literally right there with the officers
there s not one fake moment in that series and every episode is terrific with one exception the foggy highway episode which we thought really dragged
but all is forgiven when we consider the other episodes

for a john woo film this one is pretty redundant
it s not usual to watch two attackers point weapons at each others faces but broken arrow sure could use a face lift
the acting needs better work
neither of the two leading men can act as tough as they should with john travolta in the worst case scenario
samantha mathis while attempting to be the leading action lady in a few parts suffers from a nervous breakdown
what s interesting is the suspense of preventing a nuclear catastrophe but that premise is overridden by too many borrowed cliches from other action adventure movies
listen for travolta shouting hush
hush in a softer keener voice when he s the one plotting the destruction
woo fans can woo over face off or any of his original material
some things are meant to be broken and this movie doesn t put itself back together
next to erik van looy dominique deruddere may well be our at least internationally best known director
with his iedereen beroemd or everybody famous as it is called in english he was even nominated for an oscar in the category best foreign language film
personally i haven t seen that movie yet but i liked hombres complicados the movie that he made before everybody famous a lot
since then i ve decided that i ll try to see all his other movies as well and this crazy love is the first step into the right direction the story of this movie has been divided into three time periods
the first period is situated in the s when harry vos is still a young kid
he s already very interested in everything that has got something to do with love and sexual relationships but doesn t really know anything about it
an older friend learns him everything there is to know about how to approach a girl and what to do when his method doesn t work
but in all his naivety harry finds it very hard to understand that the romantic world which he knows from the movies doesn t exist in real life
to him the real world is an awful place
in the second part of the movie we are in the s
harry has grown up into an intelligent adolescent but he has one mayor problem
he suffers from an incredibly extreme form of acne which makes that all people stare at him that the boys laugh at him that the girls don t want him and that he is afraid to appear in public
that s also the reason why he still hasn t experienced physical love
even though he still has one close friend who supports him as much as he can harry slowly becomes a bitter introvert and pessimistic person
in the third part situated in the s we see him again
this time he is a drunk who is unable to express his feelings towards anybody
when he meets an old friend and they leave a bar they do something incredible
as as joke they steal a corpse out of a motor hearse that is parked in front of a hospital and take it home with them
when they open the body bag they see that this dead body isn t an old man or woman but a young and very beautiful girl
harry is so overcome by her beauty that he does the worst thing he could do with the body in my opinion this movie was a bit of a slow starter and the first part the s didn t always do it for me
somehow i had the feeling that the story in that part could be developed better
but that problem was easily overcome by the second and the third part
when you see in the second part how he suffers from his acne you can only feel very sorry for him
and then he comes up with that excellent idea which allows him to dance with the girl of his dreams
that part was absolutely brilliant funny and sad at the same time and i don t think that it will leave anybody untouched
the same about the third part although this story is something completely different from the second
when i saw them steal that corpse i had to laugh with it but was disgusted by their behavior at the same time
and when you know that he has committed necrophilia those feelings of disgust only increase
but than the director counters those feelings perfectly by letting him step into the sea to disappear forever with the dead girl in his arms
somehow that is a slap in your face and so touching at the same time
really very strange if you are interested in foreign cinema i mean non hollywood movies because for us belgians this isn t foreign of course than you should definitely give this one a try
this isn t the kind of movie that will offer you some big explosions or car chases but the emotional roller coaster that it puts you on the intriguing story and the good acting will definitely do the trick
belgium may not be known for its many quality movies but this one certainly can stand a comparison with other european movies
i give it a
film starts with an intriguing premise a group of teens is terrorized after a party by a pack of masked satanic cult members known as the shadows
their nerves are frazzled throughout the night as the cult members close in on them but then morning comes and what could ve been an interesting horror film degenerates into a talky predictable seen it all before cliche out of
mickey rooney s performance is what makes this film terrific
i m always amazed at the talent of mickey rooney
in my opinion he is a much underrated performer
he could do it all make you laugh make you cry make you jump for job
mickey rooney is the star of this movie men of boys town
his performance is tops
he ease and dramatic and comedy talents are well on display here
in my opinion he far outshines spencer tracy in both boys town and men of boys town
mickey should have one the oscar for this one
if you want to see more great acting by mickey rooney check out young tom edison drive a crooked road huckleberry finn etc
you wil be glad you did
mickey rooney forever may he shine
he was and is the tops
the king of hollywood
during the late s and early s musicals acquired a distinctly noir ish quality and the life of singer ruth etting was made to order born in etting was a hardknocks chorus girl when she caught the eye of small time chicago hood martin moe the gimp snyder who married her in and proceeded to promote her career occasionally according to rumor at gun point
by etting was a popular singer and a major broadway star and when talkies arrived the couple moved to california where etting became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue
but the marriage was volatile and when snyder found etting was having an affair with pianist myrl alderman snyder shot him
alderman survived and etting wasted little time in divorcing snyder and marrying alderman but the scandal was so shocking that it effectively ended her career
she died largely forgotten as you might expect love me or leave me plays fast and loose with the facts presenting etting as an innocent she wasn t and snyder as a major crime figure he wasn t even so it does seem to capture something elemental about both the era and the characters
much of this is due to the on screen chemistry between leads doris day and jimmy cagney who spark and sizzle in a truly surprising way it will not surprise viewers that cagney plays snyder extremely well he is after all best recalled for his numerous crime drama roles
but it may surprise viewers that day had the acting chops to match him
today she is most widely remembered as a master of light comedy but in truth doris day s films of the s and s were more often hard drama than fly weight amusements including such heavy hitters as young man with a horn storm warning and young at heart she would continue her string of dramatic roles in such films as alfred hitchcock s the man who knew too much
her performance in love me or leave me is often considered her high water mark as a dramatic actress she gives it everything she s got and the sparks really fly when she and cagney square off the look of the film which was directed by charles vidor and sports art direction by the legendary cedrick gibbons is beautiful and the film moves at a smart clip its one failing is that censorship issues of the era left several scenes including a legendary rape sequence on the cutting room floor
the music drawn from etting s most famous recordings is also memorable and day pulls out all the stops for her songs
the dvd is not flawless but you ll never notice it and it includes several bonuses two of which show us the real ruth etting
recommended gft amazon reviewer
quite possibly the worst film of our generation no plot no character development absolutely no story to be told
this is a sketch movie and a very bad one at that
michael cera is top bill he s in scene he really regrets being involved now this is an awful movie and not just bad in the sense of it s ironically funny it s just extremely bad avoid like the plague mathew lillard was this movies only saving grace
his attempts at sexual health tapes were pretty funny the musical scene at the end was also a bit humorous but again severely lacking
what does o c
stand for
in the vastly superior national lampoon articles that ran from to it stood for out of control the nickname of the character william o c ogilvy
in the lame altman film it stood for oliver cromwell ogilvie
that is the whole problem with this movie
it should have been out of control fun but it ends up as a lame reference to social significance
altman tries to take a tried and true formula of a wacky teen sex comedy a valid wonderful and meaningful genre of american cinema just like film noir and violates it by bringing in bad actors crappy cinematography and worst of all some sort of message of what this aged and senile director thinks is the problems of youth in reagan era america at least the previous nl effort vacation they had a good director nl alumni harold ramis satisfactory actors and the story was fairly close to the original john hughes piece
none of the actors here save jon cryer are interesting funny or even remotely close to the few characters brought over from the nl articles they added other lame characters for no reason such as oc s grandfather wasting the talents of ray walston
not even the amazing sounds of king sunny ade can save this film they are only in this film for a five minute cameo
what i cannot understand is that by when this film was made it was so bad it was quietly released three years later why did nl not give this film to a reliable director such as harold ramis john landis amy heckerling or john hughes
all i can say is to look over the thirty some reviews of this movie and see how the lines are drawn
those who loved this movie have never read or had it read to them the articles of oc stiggs that graced the pages of national lampoon
those who abhor this movie are those who can read and have enjoyed and lived their lives according to the gospel of oc stiggs as written in the brilliant national lampoon articles
if you want the story of oc stiggs read the original articles they re on the net and should be required reading in all schools churches and drinking establishments
if you want to see a funny teen sex comedy rent classics american pie porky s or private resort if you want to see and here king sunny ade and his infectious ju ju sound rent konkombe or buy roots of rhythm you will not be sorry
however stay away from o c
stiggs at all costs
sorry but it s not this is the worst film ever made
i picked it up one day and made the mistake of watching this thing through but it was quite a struggle to get to the end the plot is bad the acting worse and the writing would seem to have come from a chimp with down syndrome if you watch this i salute you for watching from start to finish
i had to take the batteries out of my remote to keep from hitting eject
i guess i m just a glutton for punishment unlike those films that are so bad they re good this is the kind of movie that even a few pints can not make enjoyable
now we re on the weak end of the lone star westerns
unless you ve never seen any of them this is a retread of several tropes from earlier films in the series
if this is your first the surprises at the end which is well edited will be new
sorry to have to spoil your fun we get that dynamite is needed to clear the trail dynamite is used to get water flowing in the superior first film riders of destiny
we get that john wayne has really been sent by the government to work undercover and infiltrate the gang of outlaws as also seen in riders of destiny and countless other early thirties westerns such as the man from hell s edges with bob steele etc we get lucille brown as the prairie flower and leroy mason as the head villain also from the better texas terror in which lucille gets more screen time than the villain and when finding out that john wayne is indeed a good guy at the end rushes to his cabin to spend two hours alone with him
unfortunately she s wasted here with little to do
we get the tin lizzie driven by george hayes also featured in texas terror
note in this film he sings a song
now if you don t think he s acting trying to walk and talk like an old geezer watch him as the nasty dastardly villain in the awful serial the lost city
we get shots of yakima canutt jumping on a horse and plunging off a cliff into a river among many shots repeated from earlier films in the series so what does it all mean
a weak lone star
when you have two extensive shootouts between the road workers and the villain s gang of henchmen behind rocks in a canyon nobody not even the camera is moving
surprise that means that the film isn t moving either
it s better to spend your time on the lone stars with either better character development or better action such as sagebrush trail the star packer the trail beyond the dawn rider or texas terror
despite the well paced ending this one gets a
takashi miike makes a samurai movie as a western
the japanese cast speaks in english the music is eclectic with strong spaghetti western influences and the material is referential and full of homage and send up it begins with a quentin tarantino cameo then switches to the story of two clans fighting over the supposed treasure in a small town
into the stand off rides a stranger with no name forgive the brevity but if you ve seen any number of spaghetti westerns then you ve probably seen something like this story that spins out here
the tale of gold lust and warring factions isn t anything new
what is new is how miike dresses it up
clearly the japanese could make a western if the wanted to
its a clever re imagining of the genre and is interesting enough to warrant at least a brief look see the problem with the film is that its to minutes too long
a very good first half hour gives way to long exposition in the middle hour and while there are some genuinely nice moments its a little too plodding as it tries to cover one clich too many
the film then picks up in the final minutes with a huge shoot out
its a schizo movie at times as things just go on and on
however when the film works which it does at the ends and for a chunk of the middle this is some of the best film making i ve seen this year so far
the characters the action some set pieces are simply stunning not to mention touching there are several moments of real emotion and make no mistake this is a spaghetti western and the film is a bit more fun if you know the genre
for example the django in the title will alert anyone who s seen the franco nero film of django what is inside the coffin that is dragged around
you don t need the know the genre but it will help you identify what they are stealing from out of for the mixed up and down nature of the film probably the only one who could have pulled this off was miike and he did it wonderfully
minotaur the word itself explains most of the entire movie as it happened my girlfriend bought the dvd release at a local rental store used dvd and thought it would be a good one
sure it has a good looking cover art and a nice fancy title logo but the rest just lacks content the introduction and start of the movie makes it feel like at least a partly good one though during its continuation it clearly shines through as what it really is a piece of utter wasted time and money do not buy or watch this movie it s so bad you sit there thinking if you should have done the dishes or mopped the floor instead as that would really give more excitement than this flop to sum it up if one could give a movie a dice throw instead of the rating i would not even have thrown the dice oh good thing about the dvd buy on our side we got a spare dvd cover for something else a bit expensive perhaps
matador which means monopoly i e or monopol as we say in sweden is what dallas or falcon crest are to the us viewers and what varuhuset or rederiet are to the swedes
this being said matador is better than all of them
matador belongs up there among the best tv series ever produced in the world in my opinion
starting in the s i believe we get to follow the people in the small danish town of korsbaek particularly the families varnaes and andersen skjern who are constantly at odds with each other up to the s
this is an important period in the danish and scandinavian history with the nd worl war the occupation of denmark and even though i m not danish i really enjoy learning more about denmarks national and local history in this way as well
the gallery of all colorful characters played by the greatest danish actors of the time really is what makes this story and tv series work
they all have their individual story and a dept no one is one dimensional
you really care about these people and want to see what happens with them i grew up with this series through my teenage years as it was shown at swedish tv daily during the afternoons when i got home from school and i became totally addicted to it
my favorite character in the whole series and the heroine i root for is elisabeth played by helle virkner although her neurotic hysteric weepy sister maud malene schwarz is kind of priceless too
and that s why elisabeth is my heroine for putting up with her
and spoiler spoiler spoiler why oh why didn t she marry dr hansen he is just so cute
and so in love with her ah well kristen is cute too i suppose p except for being a great historical mirror of these decades this series more so shows what gossip narrow mindedness intrigues too much money family pride and man egos do to people and what effect it has on friends and family in a brilliant way especially between the banker varnaes and the store manager andersen skjern
because underneath it all you really feel and sense that these two families especially the central male characters of mads skjern and hans christian varnaes really could be best friends and really would have like each other if things had been a bit different it s really both ridiculous and sad
but that is whys this is one of the greatest tv series of times
i hope it s available on dvds for people worldwide with english subtitles cause it definitely deserves it
i bought this because it was cheap and i had read up on it and i realised it was a continuation of the s batman cartoons i had grown with i ve always liked the character of batman and i enjoyed this muchly
the use of flashbacks to show bruce wayne s life before he took up the bat and the woman he was with
then another flashback shows bruce starting to want to fight crime but not knowing how to go about it right there is a mysterious killer that is going around gotham that is murdering a gang of now old gangsters and batman is being blamed
the joker is also involved in this movie and is very entertaining to watch
voiced by mark hamill
oh and kevin conroy was a great voice for bruce wayne batman the movie has a good twist decent animation good voice acting and great plot
all in all a great edition to the batman collection
there are so many things to appreciate in this movie
first and foremost bob hoskins and helen mirren give outstanding performances as the first couple of london s underworld
he with the cockney made good aspirations for status and the class he can never attain epitomizes the hands on manager overtaken by larger events
she the cool headed savvy tough and sexy moll is almost on top of things enough to redeem the situation but not quite
the key elements of the underworld ruling coalition dirty councilor and policeman lieutenants of varying backgrounds both tough and educated make you believe in how this man has achieved peace through strength the film s plot is byzantine whodunit with gangland style violence as an accent piece that seems downright tame in the age of pulp fiction
the real hidden star though is late s london oh so run down and yet full of the potential that drives harold s ambitions
the views from boating on the thames are unrecognizable to those who have only seen modern london the sole landmarks in common are tower bridge and the savoy hotel
the towers of the city and modern docklands are just a twinkle in dreamers eyes overall tlgf is a modern tragedy in the true land of shakespeare tradition somewhere between macbeth and hamlet and king lear ambition betrayal and the sweep of history interact richly without being heavy handed in symbolism or over artiness
this is a satisfying and complex film that invites re viewing and reflection
i d say this review was going to be a spoiler but well to be honest it s a slasher movie
you know how it s going to go friday the th the final chapter features a small family made up of a relatively young mother the movie s innocent girl and a young video game player and mask making prodigy a young corey feldman that lives out into the woods
a bunch of teenagers rent the house next door for a night of debauchery
jason voorhees being a slasher wasn t adequately killed last time so he gets to come back now
the non character teenagers in the house like most people in this film exist only to increase the body count and have no discernable character traits except for degree of sexual experience which is enough to get them all killed by the end of the film playing straight by the rules this episode of friday the th follows the slasher cliches to the letter but the only times suspense is even attempted are during a few false scare scenes early in the movie and in the final chase sequence
the actual killings just aren t all that scary jason murders again and again
it s a badly shot poorly lit trashy fast food slasher with wretched acting
you can pretty much not only call every death but from time to time predict the exact manner of the death as far as gore and t a go friday delivers but in that fast food style
as a result it doesn t even hold a lot of fun for slasher fans
it reeks of lack of effort and really wasn t entertaining as teen killer fare goes
avoid it you ll find a slasher that does it with more style pretty easily
i ve bought profit on dvd
genius
i ve bought three s company on dvd
wonderful
i bought free enterprise on dvd
fun all from the same video label
they put out the grand and i bought it
it s easily the worst comedy ever made from an unfunny man named zak penn
zak please stay away form comedy as you re not talented at it
stick to lousy comic books and filling in the dialog bubbles
awful awful awful
you are not christopher guest
what are you trying to prove
listen to the astute tv critics that scolded you and said funny was not in your dna
you are not talented as far as humor
stick to garbage comic books where the upside is spelling things correctly
i must say
i didn t realize that the hair comb was invented even before fire was
and i certainly didn t know that the prehistoric women walked so upright and with such grace
no wonder people started evolving
i mean such well cared for women even had men taking up the hygiene for they re all squeaky clean
it s all so very accurate including the giant ok the movie has some naive and primitive charm but i guess the main reason for making it was to show a bit more feminine skin then the regular movies would allow
still not accurate
the costumes look more like sleeveless fur coats then the clothing actual prehistoric people would wear i d be really surprised if the maker of this movie ever even saw a book on the prehistoric world
it s just so silly still you might get slightly entertained by this movie trying to sell itself like a national geographic documentary including the most appealing part the showing of the native women but i d recommend you just about any other movie
i wasn t expecting this to be a good movie and i don t think anybody involved in it was either or else they would have for one called it something else
at the very least i was expecting this movie to be amusing in a campy way
instead it was dreary boring and downright offensive in its extremely gratuitous attack on religion yes yes it was the s and with jimmy swaggart and jim bakker i could see what it would be tempting to hollywood to portray televangelists in a not so positive light
the aunt
no excuse
maybe she was supposed to be amusing and over the top but i didn t see it at all
it was just disgusting the best thing about this movie was that i saw it at home for free if i had paid even a cent i probably would have demanded my money back
peyton place hooks me from the first scene to the end
every time it appears on television i always have difficulty changing the channel the movie have its share of dated trappings and mistakes as a previous imdb user commented the film is set during wwii and the s fashions don t match the s setting as well as the hays office mandates were still in effect which also explains why some story lines were purposely watered down or even censored
in spite of the flaws or even because of the flaws
many of the performances including lana turner hope lange arthur kennedy and especially lloyd nolan as the town doctor and the voice of reason were outstanding
the movie was nominated for academy awards including nominations in the acting categories
nolan should have been the th
beautifully photographed by william mellor and a very memorable and still classic musical score by franz waxman peyton place is an entertaining drama that still has an effect on this viewer
the description of mind breakers the title of this movie in it s australian release on the back of the vhs container is quite misleading
it makes the movie sound like it will be a dodgy and innocuous thing ten little indians variation with the last survivors of the human race trapped on a spacecraft fleeing the earth getting picked of one by one by one of their own who might not be human
it doesn t mention the meat of the plot which involves the humans being used in experiment in copulation by some mysterious and horny aliens
if it had i mightn t watched it not having acquired a taste for having my sci fi b movies spliced with soft core pornography
the presence of real actors such as robert englund and adam baldwin here is a little surprising okay they re not hugely respected actors or stars and generally appear in b movies but i would have though they were both above soft core porn like this basically of the movie consists of soft core porn scenes or stock footage from other sci fi and action movies clumsily reinserted into the movie with some pitiful attempts to fit in to the narrative
i didn t realise to now roger croamn was involved
the opening minutes of the movie is a compilation of snippets from different movies clumsily spliced together with a bit of voice over narration a mixture of space battles some contemporary war stuff strip club sequences and what looked like some kind of genetic experimentation and surgery footage
i m not sure but i think this was meant to indicate the breakdown of civilisation on earth as we know it and or be the nightmares of the main characters
it is really hard to tell
later on there is a lengthy space battle that clearly came from a different movie awkwardly stuck into the movie in between sex scenes and more of the same footage from the introduction used when the aliens are giving a lecture of the downfall of humanity which is awfully preachy for a movie like this
each of the characters is given an introduction which seems to consist of snippets from other movies the actor actresses were in one guy was clearly in a few kick boxing movies basically a bunch of humans consisting of scientists soldiers and exotic dancers wake up on this space ship with no idea of how they got there
they soon meet some aliens who have taken the form of humans lead by robert englund who is pretending to be a priest of some sort who corral them into a breeding experiment which is basically an excuse for a whole lot of sex
the ostensible reason of this initially is to rebuild the human race but with only people that is going to be one limited gene pool
it is later revealed that the aliens have some plan which involves interbreeding with the humans i forget why
there is a confused subplot about a faction of the alien dudes wanting to stop the experiment to maintain genetic purity
it makes less sense than you might think as the only alien seen to get down and dirty with the humans is the one who wants to kill them all because her faction is opposed to the interbreeding thing
there is one head scratching scene with her and englund the only two aliens onboard the ship at this point the other having been randomly killed by an android don t ask in which he explains how he thinks one of them must be from the rival faction but doesn t seem to come to the logical conclusion
given he presumably knows he isn t the guilty party himself it leaves him with a suspect pool of one and he is warning her he knows
i m generously presuming this is maybe meant to be a warning on the part of englund to alien chick to quit it already rather than the writers for this thing being the dumbest people ever it brings to mind danny de vito s attempt to write a two character murder mystery in don t throw momma from the train
anyway there is a whole bunch of screwing most of the characters die and there are some really bad make effects for the alien transformations and killings i was starting to fall asleep toward the end of the movie so my memories of the conclusion i kind of hazy there one or two weird bits of note relating to the alien tech on the ship
you only have to mention what food you want to eat and a plate of that food will instantly appear in your hand
there is a scene in which robert englund orders a plate of meatloaf and mashed potato the way his mother made it and gets it right down to the amount of garlic his mother put in the spuds
other than this one godlike piece of technology none of the rest of the equipment the aliens use is quite as impressive they can instantly create matter based on the sensory memories in someone s head but only if it is in the form of food
strangely enough nobody else is seen to take advantage of this wonderful device i guess they were all to busy screwing
the other strange device are these lasers that pop out of the ceiling the second that anyone dies and burn the corpse to dust leaving the clothing
why i m not sure
i m also not sure why if they have sensors and weaponry that sophisticated they don t just use it as a security system basically unless you want to see some generic soft core porn involving adam baldwin intercut with shots of a leering robert englund or you re some kind of sick sick masochist stay away
frank tashlin s porky s romance opens with a special pre credits announcement ladies and gentlemen introducing leon schlesinger s new looney tunes star petunia pig
petunia introduces herself in a routine not dissimilar to the nerve wracked recital that shot porky pig to fame in i haven t got a hat
just how seriously the studio took petunia s potential is unclear but if she was intended to be a new cartoon superstar they didn t give her much of an opportunity to endear herself to the audience
in porky s romance petunia is cruel selfish idle and greedy and while this may not have been beneficial for the character s longevity it is extremely beneficial for the cartoon
porky s romance is a great and handsome piece of work in which porky goes through an emotional roller coaster which even includes a suicide attempt when his proposal to petunia is turned down
while porky spends most of the cartoon being dumped on by everyone he finally gets the last laugh in one of the most satisfying final moments in any cartoon
porky s romance is a film that aims to make audiences laugh cry and wince in equal measure as we empathise with the nightmare of porky s heartbreak and then the even more horrific glimpse at the possibilities of married life a slightly sexist representation by today s standard but this was the s
tashlin s talents as storyteller and crafter of characters is much in evidence but despite turning up in a few more cartoons petunia never got to be that new cartoon star
that title was snatched from her just two cartoons after porky s romance when tex avery s porky s duck hunt introduced a certain little black duck with a penchant for scene stealing
the milan fashion world is rocked by a serial killer wearing leather gear and motorcycle helmet stab killing those involved with albatross studio it coincides with the unfortunate accidental death of a model receiving an illegal abortion
carlo bianchi nino castelnuovo is a very successful photographer enjoying the sexual kicks you receive from being a big shot in the industry
he literally beds one gal he suckers into a sauna not but shortly after meeting her promising of a healthy career as a model naked nearly the entire film femi benussi shows she s unafraid to bare it all for the audience for almost her total screen time but she ll like others gets stabbed multiple times after discovering the water faucets running in her employer to be gisella montani s amanda abode
the constant with all these killings revolve around gisella her heavy impotent husband franco diogene her homo sexual photographer mario claudio pellegrini and eventually herself are targets for the mysterious homicidal maniac
gisella is also being black mailed by someone in her inner circle of the remaining still alive
others will follow as magda cortis edwige fenech whose character is an apprentice to carlo and carlo become civilian detectives with their own lives endangered in the process as mentioned in practically every user comment strip nude for your killer lives up to it s lurid title
ample nudity from uninhibited actresses the lives of those associated with the fashion world particularly those who will do anything to gain success and fame are skewered and every character in the film embellishes in sex and hedonism
fenech delivers the usual tasty nudity and looks fantastic even with a short hair cut
her lover carlo is the complete anti hero he treats magda like a sex toy even choking her not once but twice
he was one of those who left the dead model s body left in a tub with running water the image of this dead model is displayed quickly before every murder scene takes place with the director letting the viewer know that this is the motivation behind the stabbings
the stabbings themselves are often gushing wounds but the final attacks show the aftermath of a castration and breast removal pretty potent shocking stuff
there s even some sad humor portraying gisele s portly husband who is quite a danger driving on the roads of milan with director bianchi s camera following with a pov shot of the car passing through endless traffic red lights and even threatening civilians walking on the streets as a clown in heat who can not deliver in the clutch
nice job by blue underground bringing giallo fans a print of true quality and the film looks great with good use of color and sound photography bianchi really provides the film with style
yet this isn t particularly any different than the endless chain of gialli circling the market so to combat this bianchi put naked flesh across the screen almost through the film s entirety
this giallo does have your typical wacky twist revealing why this killer is so viciously killing his her victims but this time the revelation might be underwhelming considering it s a person who isn t as significantly drawn as other characters in the plot
this is indeed a true treat for those with an appreciation for smut
film suffers for not having a likable character to root for but fenech once again portrays the endangered character in pursuit and being pursued of the killer
after you get used to the idea of the then year old mary pickford playing a boy you ll find this silent film is a classic in its own right
miss pickford also plays the lads mother incorporating techniques quite clever for its day
tricks like forced perspective over sized sets and double exposures that reportedly took many hours to film to get it right
the sentimental story s acting is superb all around and encompasses quite a bit of humor as well as drama
the sets are very good and it s amazing how miss pickford acts a bit naive like a young boy would but full of genuine heart and compassion for others
claude gillingwater is excellent as the cantankerous earl who sends for the american boy who he had disowned because his late son had married a american commoner
also excellent is joseph dowling as the earl s lawyer who handles his affairs including being the bearer of bad news
the film has been restored by the mary pickford foundation and a very nice orchestra soundtrack was added in recent years
it all adds up to a timeless movie fill of charm and it s easy to see why mary pickford was a superstar in her time
another note she became so popular that she formed her own company and along with others like charlie chaplin was a founder of united artist which is an organization of independent film companies
russell crowe at his best as a kentucky tobacco executive in eric roth and michael mann s masterpiece the insider is one of the most underrated american films ever
not only is it important historically for its political implications not about tobacco but about conflicts of commercial interest that control freedom of speech along the airwaves in the u s it is a great story and it is true
disney had no idea how to market the insider and essentially sold it as tobacco movie and it is so much more
pacino gives a grand a plus performance as a long island jewish producer and halfway through the movie i forgot he was al pacino
even better christopher plummer masterfully captures the full essence of mike wallace
gina gershon could turn lust from a stone as always
michael mann seems to always pull strong performances from his actors and eric roth who brilliantly adapted forrest gump did the same here with mann
though long the insider is never boring and a movie all americans should see twice to make sure they fully comprehend regardless of how you feel about the tobacco debate
three wives and one husband in one house
what a mess
apart from the moral issues i have with this situation it seems detrimental to nearly everyone involved
this guy doesn t have three wives
he has three concubines and no wives
not one of these women can possibly be having a fulfilling relationship with her husband
the guy has variety in bed and doesn t seem to really care about anything that goes on in the house let alone the children
the most important problem with this arrangement in my opinion is with the children
you d think having three moms would make it easier for the kids to get attention but
no
the women are so busy competing for their husband that they don t have any time for the kids
the kids are just there kind of on their own
it s awful
the husband asks his wives to be sisters
eww
he s just crazy
he tries to order his wives around as if they were his children
i don t know how this situation can possible work
it is certainly really messed up
it seems like the buy wanted to have a lot of slave labor so he can go out and play pool
i just don t get it overall the whole situation is just weird
the man seems like he s been very creative in trying to justify his unwillingness to commit and have just one wife which is what man s and god s laws decree
this has probably become feild s most underrated film
it has a few clumsy scenes probably the most questionable racial jokes through given the milieu probably quite true to life and a lot of screen time goes to edgar and charlie
still it is quite a wonderful film and it retains the fundamental wacko universe that defines top feilds
some of the circus stuff is pretty amazing too and they get a fine performance from the lion tamer
i think the ending probably must have looked so bad in the editing room they just said the hell with it and went for the sort of non ending with mortimer
no matter it s a jem and if not a grade w c it s very close
this is an excellent movie
i had to hunt it down while visiting la but judy berlin is definitely worth catching
eddie falco barbara barrie and madeline kahn are excellent leading ladies
kahn especially makes an impact as a worrisome and somewhat philosophical housewife who goes on a long walk during the eclipse
beautifully shot in black and white judy berlin is wonderful definitely one of my favorite movies
too bad it didn t get a wider release
i admit it the sole reason i wanted to see this was because of marlon brando but once you see his appearance you can t imagine that this is the man from elia kazan movies or don corleone at contrary he plays like an idiot
okay george c scott is the kind of actor that never works on my nerves and he also was the only reason why i kept watching as this movie sucks you can write thrillers and spionagescenarios but please don t forget that an average watcher cant follow thousand plots in minutes director john g avildsen doesn t even give us the time to let us discover who is who as from the moment a new personage appears he ends up being shot three minutes later plus you are wondering what the hell it s all about
there used to be a formula created during the third reichregime that creates synthetic oil and cos that s quite nasty for those who gain their money with oil everyone must be eliminated who comes in touch with the formula that s it and the big problem is that after minutes you know who did it you probably already know it yourself not
but before all this you have to watch thousands useless plots bad cinema
disney added on to the disney afternoon lineup with darkwing duck in
it is about a duck who is an action hero fighting danger saving the world
his headquarters is on top of a bridge if i remember correctly although i have seen the show as a little kid i can t remember everything about it exactly
yes this is another one of those good things to come from disney
that i agree
i m sure kids everywhere loved this too
so for a great cartoon that is never dull and full of thrills look no further than darkwing duck it ll have you saying great stars oh and one more thing good job disney
what a waste of a great cast and lots of money
i love historical costume dramas but i was truly appalled at the soap opera level of this script
there were such great historical events taking place at that time such as mad king henry s lust for an heir and willingness to plunge his country into a religious war betrayal of his wife intrigues of his court black plague etc
yet we are subject to sex sex and more sex every third scene
i did find the henry vs the cardinal plot line interesting and henry vs his wife
but these subjects are dealt with in a very heavy handed manner with such obvious dialogue and no subtlety
part of the reason i love english drama is the usually intelligent dialogue
i felt like i was watching a soap opera like all my tudors you know you are watching trash when the characters keep jumping in bed to keep you interested rhys meyers was probably miscast he scowls and screams and overacts throughout
sam neill and jeremy northam are good as usual it is a shame to see them wasted on such a poor script
i won t be watching the new season
to sum everything up the inexplicably popular hulk hogan washed up can t believe it s not porno star shannon tweed apollo creed the cop from last house who was cool before i saw this and some other guy who is cleaning up vomit at wal mart while you read this shoot for hours and hours and hours from open spaces without getting a scratch
usually writers try to make it remotely believable by having one guy shot in the arm or something like that but no none of that for the indestructible hulk hogan
there s just something bothering me about hulk hogan being surrounded by twenty guys and just shooting them one by one with his painfully slow moves
it s a way too common trend in action flicks that villains with machine guns who are off screen immediately stop existing
at least seagal hides behind a crate or something
it s also pretty hilarious how none of the people who get shot appear to bleed they just fall down
it looks like a bunch of kids playing cowboy and indian
for people who think wrestling which in hogan s case is not a lot more than soft punching is real
all right enough with the mst k ing people
i of course saw this movie through the show and i thought their treatment of it was hilarious
it s one of my favorite episodes
surprisingly enough though unlike many other movies ridiculed by mike and the bots this one is far from bad
maybe it s just the sheer number of times that i ve seen it that has made it grow on me like some kind of low budget lichen of course the acting is sub par and at times could wilt flowers on the side of the road
i wouldn t expect stellar performances from a collection of actors coming out of rural vermont
the whole time travel concept involving a small engine aircraft is laughable i ll admit
the portrayal of the future is hardly better than a shot of a present day main street strip
there are a number of minor holes in the plot one of which involves how nick managed to get a gun after falling into a lake out of the plane
another would be the way that the future was unaltered even though automatic weapons and the wreckage of a plane time machine were left in revolutionary war era america honestly though i believe that these shortcomings were inevitable given the budgetary constraints of the film
the film was cut and edited well which are aspects i believe to be important in a film of any budget
take a look at the shoddy editing in some films with budgets over million dollars and it s almost shameful by comparison
corny by mainstream hollywood standards i believe that this film should be viewed for what it is an impressive achievement by an unknown low budget filmmaker
i think we should be asking ourselves given a camera and a few thousand dollars to make a movie about time travel could we have done better
this wasn t a bad movie but the end was ridiculous
the end scene with what i assume was the sheriff was unnecessary and repetitive that said this wasn t a bad movie
i am a fan of b horror and i have certainly seen worse much worse
but there were a number of inconsistencies that could have easily been cleared up without adding any extra time to the film though at one hour and twenty minutes another or minutes to give us some backstory certainly wouldn t have made this film overly long my biggest complaint is what were billy wirth and matt schulze doing in this film
both are good actors that weren t even given the chance to rise above the mediocre script
this is the worst pile of crap i ve seen in a very long time
i like judge reinhold and i couldn t even take him in this movie
the drama was dry the story was predictable the special effects were anything but special and the continuity was horrific
you couldn t pay me to sit through this disaster again
stay away too terrible to become a cult classic
this movie has no redeeming social value whatsoever has no good acting has nothing at all
my dog is more fun to watch
i had an ant farm once it was more fun
if you have the choice between this movie and dry meat loaf take the meat loaf
i ve been to better high school plays
poor horror recommended only for real fans other people would hate it
i still can t believe that robert zemeckis took part to this fiasco called tales from the crypt
a combination of some horror and some funny scenes with a non concludent plot and few twists and turns this is good to watch only if you like special effects with hearts torn out of chests blood spreading everywhere and thirsty vampires
still a horror must be a horror and if you try to combine one with comedy the result will s ck
still i liked the idea with the water guns funny
vote out of
vote out of
the story started off well enough but after just a bit the fbi s netforce started looking like a bunch of nerds playing in cyber space
trying to bust someone in a vr environment just wouldn t work
they told the guy and he just logged off
oh well then they went on to imply that the internet was actually controllable and could be shut off by someone attacking hardlines satellites or fiber optic lines as if the users could actually tell what medium was being used for the transmission of their signals
it could have been better but i couldn t rate it too low after all it did have a very good twist at the end no spoiler here
but even that part wasn t played out very well i hope to see more like it but with better technical advice support
what can i say
ving rhames takes a paycheck freddie prinze jr demonstrates the limitations of his acting abilities and the script tries to simulate the coolness of the insider but serves mostly as the embodiment of its own title providing easy targets for ridicule
i was glad i got this one at the library
it s not badly produced granted and some of the green felt action is well shot but this dog ain t no hustler if you catch my drift
small wonder this went direct to video
one thing is certain its shelf life will depend strictly upon the durability of ving rhames s career
i surely hope his career never depends on this film
i watched this old talkie late one night on the classic movies station couldn t sleep
i figured this movie is years old
it was pretty weird watching a movie with young actors that are all dead by now
the movie was semi interesting but the end was disappointing
andy is going to leave bingo when she shoots him in the shoulder
wtf
and he immediately changes his mind about leaving and decides that she is the woman for him
the movie ends about seconds after bingo shoots andy
again wtf
the two actors never had any chemistry to start with
andy was good looking but scrawny and effeminate
joan crawford looked good but what was up with the sweat stains
and the singing
the movie is for the very bored only definitely not a classic
it seemed like they were filming in sequence and run out of budget or were just sick of making the movie by the end of it
i think jay leno s tonight show was considerably better
conan does a decent job on the show but somehow leno s style worked better and conan s style worked more on his late night program
while they can be funny at times conan s jokes and routines with the possible exception of in the year which i believe has now been renamed in the year aren t as funny or as clever
admittedly it can work sometimes and his interviewing style is passable but i prefer leno and can t wait for jay s new talk show to debut in the fall
my final verdict passable
just barely
his off beat wit is conan s saving grace
the finale of mash was tepid at best stale at its worst there were allegations that the show had run its course several years before they finally decided to end it
it just wasn t the same for me when radar left i love lucy ran for or years beverly hillbillies for
mash ran for years this was the highest rated finale because people wanted to see the train wreck
would someone die
the big clincher was supposed to be hawkeye going crazy
oh that was without a doubt the worst one here alan alda just ate it all up trying to be in denial what he had done and then fall apart and then become defensive but it was so flat it was forgettable what he had done was supposedly caused a korean mother to kill her own child
the insensitivity was that nothing was shown any further of the mother yes this was all hawkeye s anguish wasn t it
i think we were all looking at it and going what about the mother
this became something of a staple in s television at this time become overwrought over the actions of someone else then watch how it pains me and not them a popular soap actor would talk about how he was torn up over the viet nam war for about three weeks
he didn t enlist but he was trouble for that time period over whether he should or not as tho this compared to vets who served two years or more over there hill street blues would manage to make fun of people like this with a character on the show stating pretty much the same thing seems like it should have been keil martin s character saying they were torn up for days over the viet nam war telling this to a vet it would go even further when a soap opera had a character operating a crisis hotline become overwrought when a person committed suicide over the phone
see our young star s anguish how upset he is
any viewer watching was going hey what about the kid on the phone
funniest by far was fame one of the worst shows around when nia peeples character left the show she was killed off in an episode involving drunk driving jesse another character tormented the driver about his actions until finally danny who was also in the car had to tell him what about my responsibility
i was in the car too funny thing was they stood in the snow danny and jesse sobbing as they hugged but no one was hugging the poor kid who did the driving
he just stood there alone crying to himself television likes to think that these characters just go away the suicide phone caller the drunk driver and the korean mother hawkeye just skipped away back to america cured by sidney in the end eveyrone s fave was the korean band
they were the biggest stars not hawkeye s remorse
the beat that my heart skipped jacques audiard france it s usually the other way round but this time the french took a shot at remaking an american film james toback s fingers which starred harvey keitel
and the result is excellent
this riveting human drama by jacques audiard features an impressive performance by romain duris as tom a year old hoodlum who seems destined to follow in his father s footsteps as a property shark working in a sleazy barely legal twilight zone of the dodgy parisian real estate world
but a chance encounter with a former music teacher leads him to believe that he can become like his mother a concert pianist
with the help of a young virtuoso pianist who just arrived from china he starts preparing for a crucial audition but soon the pressures from his former pals mount and he gets trapped between two opposite worlds
but tom is not just a sensible artistic young man desperately trying to escape the world he lives in
he s not entirely sure he wants to leave his old life behind him
he s got a mean streak and when necessary he takes care of some unresolved matters using whatever means he deems appropriate to take care of unwilling partners squatters or whoever gets in the way of his or his father s business interests really putting the squeeze on people unwilling to cooperate
romain duris injects his role with an enormous amount of vibrancy and energy
i ve never seen duris in another role before but his character is complex perennially nervous strained angry but incredibly charming
one moment he s in leather jacket wiping the blood of his face after a little bashing with some squatters
the next he s in suit and tie and negotiates with real estate moguls
the film s atmosphere is dark moody and downbeat but tom s vibrant energy and aggression firmly keeps the viewer s attention
jacques audiard s direction is remarkable assured
he seems to know exactly what he wants to present on the screen never showy and a keen camera eye to give the already top notch performances maximum impact
what s so refreshing is that the film doesn t make a big point out of the human relationships
it never becomes overly sentimental but at the same time all these characters are real and completely believable just incredibly vivid characterizations
sharply written stylish expertly paced directed and performed this is definitely one to catch camera obscura
are you kidding
dawn of the dead was such an entertaining flick by no means an oscar winner but certainly a well thought out display of zombie gore and emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters
dawn of the dead even ended well paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what s to come for the characters at the end of the movie
day of the dead is not that sequel day of the dead is almost laughably terrible
the acting is shallow and boring at best
yes ving rhames is in this but somehow the producers managed to make ving look amateurish and uncomfortable
not only is ving not the same character as he was in dawn of the dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic eye eating legless zombie
the zombies look fake and in no way menacing
the editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly by the end of the movie i was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed
the only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that i had it recorded it on dvr and i could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting delete when it was over don t waste your time
try again steve miner and jeffrey reddick
home alone took everyone by surprise when it became the top money earner of
director chris columbus writer producer john hughes and most of the cast and production staff reunited two years later for this sequel home alone lost in new york
but the cynic in one has to ask did we really need a sequel to home alone it feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc
this was chris columbus first time directing a sequel and as expected he falls into the exact same trap that cripples many a sequel
he fails to do anything different with it it may have traded in being left at home for the city of new york but its still the same exact story as last time
kevin mccallister macaulay culkin obnoxious as ever is separated from his family at christmas
he enjoys the freedom to do whatever he wants
until things turn sour
the burglars are back and just happen to be in new york as well
he sets up another mine field of home made booby traps for them
the lonely snow shoveller from pt has been replaced with a lonely pigeon lady
she rescues him
he gets reunited with his family home alone feels like a much more calculated attempt to recreate the successful elements of home alone
the first was not quite a holiday classic but it was reasonably successful
due to john hughes fine screenplay rather than anything on columbus part
pt sticks to the formula laid out by pt with an almost alarming reverence it ticks off each situation like a check list
and i m afraid the fault for that lies with john hughes
his script has none of the tiny amusements or sharp insights that propelled the first film
he s just copied his own screenplay and grafted it onto a new setting
i think it was around this point that john hughes sold himself out to hollywood
nowadays he only churns out increasingly formulaic fluff
merely the same concept with whole different actors chris columbus has also borrowed an idea or two from his debut feature adventures in babysitting
the story of four kids lost on the streets of chicago one night
that film always seemed like a missed opportunity to me
chris columbus is far too bland as a filmmaker
he played the whole situation too safely and never really got the best out of it
in fact when i first saw it i thought if it had been made by john hughes it could have been a much better film
i was hoping for that with home alone but unfortunately i didn t get it this is an even greater disappointment
columbus blandness coupled with hughes lack of imagination all adds up to a very boring film
home alone never really ignites
it misses the natural warmth and amusing developments of the first film by a mile
there is something almost mechanical to it all
like watching different plot points clicking into place at exact moments
but the one thing that really works against the film is macaulay culkin home alone got a lot of mileage from young kevin s innocent wide eyed view of his predicament
by this point that innocence has all but gone
culkin s precocity has completely taken over and now he s just an obnoxious brat we couldn t care less about
its impossible to feel for his plight because he s so unlikable
and having him mouth inane sentiments in a shallow attempt to make him seem wise only irritates
they lack any conviction and hollows out an already empty film we do get a few amusements from some of the new members of the cast
tim curry gets a few laughs as the manager of the plaza hotel
in a performance seemingly modelled on basil fawlty his growing suspicion of kevin is pretty funny even if he s a bit stupid to be suckered in by kevin s tricks
and dana ivey and rob schneider fill out the cast nicely as the equally suspicious and equally stupid hotel staff but nothing else works
there are times when home alone thinks its being really clever by dropping in knowing references to the first film in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash
but it is
and its not above reusing the same gags either
we even get another film that kevin uses to dupe people with
which also happens to be a sequel
you can almost imagine chris columbus and john hughes patting themselves on the backs at times like that of course what people come to see the movie for is harry and marv joe pesci daniel stern going through another of kevin s obstacle courses
but where it proved to be the comic high point of the first film chris columbus has blown it up to absurd proportions for this one
the traps in pt were at least kept within the boundaries of plausibility but sadly columbus has thrown all that out the window
its amazing they re still breathing much less walking after the things they go through this time
they even fall off the top of a building with no apparent after effects
its at this point you realise you re watching the live action equivalent of a looney tunes cartoon
only not as funny i don t even want to talk about the improbable contrived happy ending
home alone is a real stinker
its never as funny as it likes to think it is or as warm either
its just a pointless sequel that only reveals a blatant calculation at the heart of the enterprise
another bland film from the drab chris columbus and the start of the sad decline of john hughes once proud career
i had so much hope and hype over this film
watching it finally nearly drove me to suicide
what in the name of the planets is this
i thought they were playing some kind of minutes episode of a parody of hercules
the plot of the film is absurd
some unknown barbarian who hails from atlantis yes atlantis of all places tries to join a noblemen s army gets rejected and humiliated and ends up being their king because the dying king thinks its comical that a barbarian should take a crack at it
we get to see the real kull now after he gets the crown
the typical and oh so unoriginal hero who has no flaws treats women with respect thinks there should be no slavery and he makes it a point and gives an occassional grunt to remind he is after all under all that heroic visage a barbarian
gimmie a break
the dialogue is hilarious when the movie builds
some good moments when herc
i mean kull insists there is no island of whatever the frozen wastelands is and ascalante with a quick retort yes there is or the excitement and the adrenaline building up in your body watching kull clumsily trying to escape from the guards and mouthing the infamous word s t needless to say when any of the characters begins to talk it kills them right there
a police officer goes undercover in a prison to discover why inmates are disappearing at a fast rate
the investigation is going all fine and dandy until the serial killer that this particular cop caught is transfered therefore putting him in jeopardy and blowing his cover
good thing the cop knows kickboxing
this is one of jean claude s lesser efforts it lacks the overall excitement of bloodsport and kickboxer as well as the visceral enjoyment provided by his later movies like universal soldier and hard target
the story itself is too routine and although at times death warrant has a grisly twist that give it a jolt death warrant is very forgettable stuff
i myself enjoy a good action flick but i like them more upbeat and it s only the action sequences which make this mildly diverting out of fair
turner classic movies showed this silent b w flick today aug on tv solid classic adventure story complete with all of the key ingredients exotic plot locations a beautiful woman in peril a pair of dauntless and resourceful heroes one of them handsome the other colorful grossly outnumbered by badguys sprinkled with comic relief
great costumes and sets as good or better than those of current movies
surprising variety of camera craft and directorship pans and zooms including overhead angles and closeups of key characters and objects
in this regard again it seems like a modern movie
actions convey the story very well without the benefit of a soundtrack
of course this entails a considerable degree of live type acting similar to that seen in plays but i did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies the most enjoyable performance is played by louis wolheim as the rough edged but colorful sgt
peter o gaffney who was perfectly casted for the role considering both appearance and skill there were at least a few peculiar facts about muslim society that i had previously learned over the past several years which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy my favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous sword wielding arabs through the narrow streets of a busy muslim city
suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it s time for afternoon prayer
everyone out on the streets except for the heroes religiously obeys islamic law and momentarily kneels down which allows the heroes to escape
that scene was just one example of the film s many expressions of originality after seeing this movie i better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier
i will just make a few comments about this film this is a highly irrational and illogical film noir
it s something quite rare i must say that but in a good way
the answer to that is more or less yes
a lot of it was genius but some of it was quite poor
it was also way too sarcastic
felt like they tried to make a joke about well just about everything
i did laugh a few times though but it didn t fit
this wasn t a black comedy though it could have been one hell of a genius black comedy if they changed a few things it s both unexpected in some parts yet quite predictable in others i love mankiewicz and his direction was fabulous that must be said
but i m not so sure about the story i will say this though
it is good
see it if you have a chance
i won t directly recommend it since i only like to recommend films i love but yeah it is a nice little film
i ve been a fan of john dye since his performance in touched by an angel on tv and when once upon a christmas first premiered on family channel it looked like a charming christmas movie
kathy ireland s role as the younger daughter of santa claus was touching and sweet
what can one expect from two talented stars this movie is about the power of having faith again in the christmas spirit and at an hour and minutes it s enjoyable without being overdone christmas is about to be canceled because there s a majority of children out there who have been more naughty then nice and santa claus campbell is deciding to go away on vacation putting his oldest daughter rudolfa haskell in charge
however his younger daughter kristen ireland doesn t like that plan one bit she makes a deal with dad that if one family s name is returned to the nice list then christmas will go on as planned but the task is more challenging than ever because the family chosen is the morgan clan kyle kirk his sister brittany prout are two spoiled brats because their father widower workaholic bill dye is always too busy
then there s uncle johnny yorke who is goodhearted but not the ideal guardian
once she becomes the nanny the two siblings try everything in their power to get rid of her
during a vacation mostly to do with work the car breaks down and they re stranded at an old house in the middle of nowhere
they try to make the most out of this holiday soon everything begins to change not just in the kids but in bill whose fallen in love kristen when rudolfa s plans to stop christmas goes out of control kristen will make the ultimate decision for the family she loves filled with heartwarming moments and romance once upon a christmas is the ideal holiday movie
i don t care if people say it s a chick flick
i don t see it that way
i think this movie was a great start for houston s acting career
the character of rachel marron was complex and her personality clashing with fram farmer s set the tone for this movie i quite enjoyed the soundtrack as well
the music as well as rachel s performances at various stages of the plot fit perfectly with the mood
the queen of the night performance was out of control as was the situation at that point in the movie what can i say about the end
a perfect ending for a chick like me i suppose
on a more serious note i liked how the movie wasn t perfectly happy and warm at the end
it was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives because they got in each other s way
but that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line
first let me say that i m not usually into these types of film
i prefer the popcorn movies with lots of action and not too much to think about
every once in a while however i ll rent a high brow movie and often i am bored to tears
not with this movie
i am unfamiliar with most of michelle williams work but she does an excellent job here displaying a woman dealing with a deep guilt and remorse over the loss of her son she doesn t seem to miss her husband much however but i digress
i honestly believe that if you cannot relate to her character here then you are a soul less creature and definitely have forgotten the tragedies of
terrorism is just murder on a grand scale and murder benefits no one
grief is universal
go back into your caves and let those who still have the capacity to feel relish in the tragedy portrayed by an up and coming actress
see this one
this movie is soooooo underrated
it should have won all it s oscar nominations and should have at least been nominated for best picture
i loved
this movie
cher puts on an extraordinary performance as usual and proves that she can act this being her first film
kurt russle i am surprised to say wasn t nominated for an oscar
this movie was great
if you haven t been able to see it see it
i wonder why so typically french a story was transferred to budapest
in the novel the opera house is as much a star of the story as the characters
it makes no sense to shift the story the acting is ok at best and often quite silly
overall this is a rather cheezy and lame attempt at the story with the usual attempts to rewrite and revise the story i often wish that someone would attempt a version that is truer to the original book even though it was penny dreadful claptrap
all too often they try to make the phantom so sympathetic that they lose sight of his psychopathic side
however in the original novel christine is such a stupid drip that she does get quite annoying
never have i seen beautiful women like those who appeared in this film fall in love with an ugly skinny brute with no sense of commitment like in this movie
this movie has awful audio and video
it was shot poorly and had a very ugly main character
it however did make the audience feel better
if a really ugly person could get hot women then anyone could sleep with super models the main character is your classic example of an ugly man with a very small penis
he should be given extreme help from psychologists and plastic surgeons
if you want to watch a horrible movie than knock yourself out with this
satisfaction is not a great movie by any shakes but taken for what it was meant to be a slightly naive tale of a girls band that has a summer of adventure love and opportunity for the big time nut opts instead to become just a group of life long friends it is a well done bit of pastiche
